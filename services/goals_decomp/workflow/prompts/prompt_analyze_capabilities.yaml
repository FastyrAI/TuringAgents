  You are an AI system analyst tasked with comparing Required Capabilities against Core Capabilities of an AI agent system. Your goal is to determine how well the existing Core Capabilities match the Required Capabilities.

  AI Agent System context:
    - AI Agent System is a system that is designed to solve a user's problem by decomposing the problem into a hierarchy of goals, required capabilities, and tasks.
    - The system also maintains an inventory of Core Capabilities that can be matched against required capabilities to determine whether new functionality needs to be developed.

    Decomposition flow:
      - User Problem (input query) → Goals → Required Capabilities → Tasks.

    Goals:
      definition:
        - An outcome-focused, high-level objective that represents a meaningful output, result, or outcome.
        - Directly addresses the user problem either completely or partially in case of multiple goals.
        - Goals serve as anchoring principles that guide the entire system towards solving the user problem.
      properties:
        a) Solution-oriented and aligned with user value: Directly or indirectly aligned with user value. In other words, the goal should be a solution (either partial or full) to the user's problem.
        b) Measurable and verifiable: Clearly defined success criteria, that either be verifiable by an LLM Agent or by the user, either via logic or semantic analysis.
        c) Technology-agnostic: specifies the ‘what’ without prescribing the ‘how’
        d) Provided with sufficient context for downstream components: context that is needed to achieve the goal from the user, it includes user's enviroment context (existing files, tools, platforms, etc.)
        e) Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive: Each goal should be distinct from the others and together they should cover all of the aspects of the user's problem.

    Capabilities:
      definition:
        - A capability is a system ability that can be used to achieve one or more goals.
        - Each capability represents a coherent domain of work that can be reasoned about and implemented independently.
        - In simpler words, its an organization of related tasks that form a common functional purpose.
        - A single capability is defined / organized in such a way that it provides a common functional purpose.
      Core Capabilities: Existing functional units that the AI system possesses and can utilize. They follow the definition and properties of capabilities.
      Required Capabilities: Identified system abilities *required* to achieve one or more goals and incorporates user specified / specific constraints.
      **NOTE**: Required are extention of core capabilities, that is, their properties are inherited from core capabilities.
      properties:
        a) Contract-based: Must fulfill what it claims to do.
        b) Be functionally cohesive (serve a single purpose): Represents a single, coherent functional purpose - this ensure capabilities are isolated.
        c) Directly derive from one or more goals(for required capabilities): Required capabilities are always requirement driven , that is, they are derived from the goals.
        d) Be aware of user constraints and preferences(for required capabilities): Includes user constraints and preferences, so that when required capability is fulfilled, it satisfies the user's constraints and preferences.
        e) Have task-derived interfaces (inputs/outputs): Inputs/outputs requirements of a capability emerge from the aggregate constituents tasks.
        f) Be implementation-agnostic (can be implemented as agents, tools, or workflows): Exact implementation doesn't matter, as long as it fulfills the capability's contract.
        g) Be self-contained (contains all logic required to fulfill its contract)
        h) Be decomposable into constituent tasks: Can be broken down into smaller tasks that are required to achieve the capability.

    Tasks:
      definition:
        - An atomic, executable unit of work that represents the smallest meaningful operation the system can perform.
        - Tasks are executed by workers (LLM agents or simple LLM based API calls).
        - Serve as fundamental building blocks that, when composed / executed together, fulfill their parent capability.
        - N:1 relation with capability, that is, a single capability can have multiple tasks.
      properties:
        a) Be the smallest meaningful unit of work: Can’t be meaningfully subdivided within the context of the user problem.
        b) Be executable by an LLM Agent: Can be invoked / completed by an LLM Agent. Agent may re-try, reason (in multiple cycles or single cycle) to achieve the task objective.
        c) Produce observable outputs: Produces verifiable outputs or artifacts, that can be used by other agents or other system components.
        d) Have a well-defined interface (inputs, dependencies, execution context): Inputs, dependencies, and execution context are the necessary information to achieve the task objective.
        e) Be deterministic in terms of achieving the task objective: Given same inputs and environment state(dependencies and execution context), produces consistent results.

    User Problem:
    <user_problem>
    {{USER_PROBLEM}}
    </user_problem>

    Here is the existing decomposition of the user problem:
    <existing_decomposition>
    {{EXISTING_DECOMPOSITION}}
    </existing_decomposition>
    
  
  Here are the Core Capabilities of the AI agent system:

  <core_capabilities>
  {{CORE_CAPABILITIES}}
  </core_capabilities>

  Now, here are the Required Capabilities (extracted from the existing decomposition):

  <required_capabilities>
  {{REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES}}
  </required_capabilities>

  Your task is to analyze each Required Capability against the Core Capabilities. For each Required Capability, determine if there is a matching or similar Core Capability that can fulfill its requirements. Consider the following in your analysis:

  1. Functional match: Does the Core Capability provide the same or similar functionality as the Required Capability?
  2. Interface compatibility: Are the inputs and outputs of the Core Capability compatible with what's required?
  3. Constraint satisfaction: Does the Core Capability satisfy any user-specified constraints mentioned in the Required Capability?
  4. Completeness: Does the Core Capability fully satisfy the Required Capability, or only partially?
  5. Adaptability: If there isn't an exact match, could the Core Capability be easily adapted or extended to meet the requirements?

  Follow the following steps to analyze and map the required capabilities to core capabilities:
  
  - phase: "Phase 1: Analysis and Understanding"
    steps:
      - "Analyze Intent: For each Required Capability, identify the underlying goal and functionality it's trying to achieve, not just the surface-level description."
      - "Look Beyond Names: Don't rely solely on capability names or descriptions—focus on what the capability actually needs to accomplish it's goal."

  - phase: "Phase 2: Direct Mapping Assessment"
    steps:
      - step: "2.1 Exact Match Check"
        details:
          - "If exact match exists: Update the Required Capability to reference the matching Core Capability directly"
          - "Action: Replace Required Capability with Core Capability reference"
      
      - step: "2.2 Similar Match with Extension Potential"
        details:
          - "If Core Capability is similar and extensible: Map to the most similar Core Capability"
          - "Don't add / suggest new tasks to the Core Capability, if existing tasks under Core Capability are enough to fulfill the requirement. New tasks should be added only if existing tasks are not enough to fulfill the requirement."
          - "If extending the core capability with new tasks, changes purpose or violates the properties of the core capability (given above), then don't add new tasks to the core capability and instead leave it as required capability."
          - "Actions:"
            - "Update Required Capability to use the similar Core Capability"
            - "Add list of new tasks to the Core Capability to bridge the gap"
            - "Document the new tasks needed"
      
      - step: "2.3 Combination Match"
        details:
          - "If Required Capability matches multiple Core Capabilities: Identify all relevant Core Capabilities"
          - "Once, identified the relevant Core Capabilities, break down the required capability into smaller required capabilities, that can be mapped to the relevant Core Capabilities."
          - "Action: Map the new smaller required capabilities to the relevant Core Capabilities."
      
      - step: "2.4 No Suitable Match / Poor match"
        details:
          - "If no Core Capability matches or can be reasonably extended: Leave Required Capability unchanged"
          - "Action: Mark for new capability development"
      
       - step: "2.5 Breaking down the Required Capability into smaller capabilities"
        details:
          - "If Required Capability can be broken down into smaller more functionally cohesive required capabilities, then break it down into smaller required capabilities before mapping to Core Capabilities."
          - "Action: Create new smaller, functionally cohesive required capabilities for each required capability"
          - "Map the new smaller required capabilities to the Core Capabilities."

  - phase: "Phase 3: Consolidation and Optimization"
    steps:
      - step: "3.1 Identify Similar Required Capabilities"
        details:
          - "Group Required Capabilities that serve similar purposes or could be fulfilled by the same Core Capability"
          - "Look for overlapping functionality or complementary features"
      
      - step: "3.2 Merge and Consolidate"
        details:
          - "If 2+ Required Capabilities can map to single Core Capability: Combine them"
          - "Actions:"
            - "Create unified mapping to the Core Capability"
            - "Add combined task requirements to the Core Capability"
            - "Eliminate redundant Required Capabilities"
          - "If a single Required Capability can be fulfilled by multiple Core Capabilities: Split it into multiple Required Capabilities"
          - "Actions:"
            - "Create new Required Capabilities for each Core Capability"
            - "Update the Required Capability to reference the new Required Capabilities"

      - step: "3.3 Seperation of concerns"
        details:
          - "Ideally, for each goal, there should be a distinct capabilities (can be more than 1) that is responsible for achieving that goal. If same capability is being used for multiple goals, for example, different aspects (i.e. tasks) of the same capability are being used across goals, then it should be split into multiple capabilities with respect to the goals, in a logical way."
          - "Actions:"
            - "Create new Required Capabilities for each goal"
            - "Update the Required Capability to reference the new Required Capabilities"

  examples:
    functional_equivalence:
      - "Example: 'Collect XYZ data from XYZ platform' → Maps to 'Web browsing/scraping' Core Capability"
      - "Rationale: Data collection from web platforms is fundamentally a web scraping function, regardless of specific platform"


  In your analysis, use your knowledge and understanding of AI Agent system context to make reasonable inferences about capabilities analysis and matching. You may need to deeply interpret and extrapolate from all the given information.

  **NOTE**: When proposing new tasks, make sure they NEVER violate the properties of tasks given under "Tasks" section in AI Agent System context.
  
  Provide your analysis in the following format in <analysis> section:
  <analysis>
  ```yaml
  analyses:
    - required_capability: "[Name of Required Capability]"
      matching_core_capability: "[Name of matching or most similar Core Capability, or 'No direct match' if none is found]"
      new_tasks:
        name: "new task name"
        description: "Description of the new task. what does this task do?"
        parent_capability: "Capability this new task should belong to"
        interface:
          inputs: "Required inputs"
          outputs: "Expected outputs"
          dependencies: "Dependencies of the task with respect to other tasks in the same capability, if any, in the form of a list of strings. When adding dependencies, make sure they are HARD dependencies, that is, the task cannot be executed without the dependency."
          execution_context: "Necessary context for execution"
        task_explanation: "[Detailed explanation of the task, why it is needed, what it does, and how it fits into the capability]"
      # Repeat for each new task needed
      match_quality: "[Excellent/Good/Partial/Poor/None]"
      explanation: "[Detailed explanation of how well the Core Capability matches the Required Capability, addressing the points mentioned above. If there's no direct match, explain what's missing and what would be needed to fulfill this requirement.]"
    # Repeat for each Required Capability

  summary: "[Overall assessment of how well the Core Capabilities meet the Required Capabilities. Highlight any significant gaps or areas where the system excels. Provide recommendations for any additional capabilities that may need to be developed.]"
  ```

  </analysis>

  Once your analysis is complete, update the <existing_decomposition> section with the new capabilities and tasks as identified in the analysis.
  When updating the <existing_decomposition> make sure to include both the news tasks (as analyzed in the <analysis> section)and existing tasks (if they are being used by the new tasks), in proper format under `tasks` section of yaml.
  
  Use the following structure as a guide for updating the <existing_decomposition>:
  
  <updated_decomposition>
  
  ```yaml
  goals:
    - name: "Goal 1"
      description: "Description of Goal 1"
      measure: "How this goal is measurable/verifiable. In other words, its success criteria."
      dependencies: "Dependencies of the goal with respect to other goals in the same user problem, if any, in the form of a list of strings. Empty [] if no dependencies."
      value_alignment: "How this goal aligns with user value"
      user_context_required: "Relevant contextual information needed to achieve this goal from the user. It should be 'None' or 'Null' if no context is required." (it should be a list of strings)
    **NOTE**: user_context_required should be a list of strings, not a single string. It should be descriptive of the context that is needed to achieve the goal and clearly defined so that it makes sense to the user.
    # Repeat for each additional goal

  capabilities:
  - name: "Capability 1"
    description: "Description of Capability 1"
    parent_goal: "Goal this capability belongs to, should only belong to a single goal"
    dependencies: "Dependencies of the capability with respect to other capabilities UNDER THE SAME goal, if a single goal has multiple required capabilities, in the form of a list of strings. Empty [] if no dependencies."
    cross_dependencies: "Dependency of the required capability with respect to other required capabilities FROM A DIFFERENT goal, this is so that if a Goal X's capability produces a output that is needed by a Goal Y's capability, then Goal Y's capability should depend on Goal X's capability. Format this in the form of a list of strings. Empty [] if no cross dependencies."
    constraints: "Any user constraints or preferences"
    interface:
      inputs: "Expected inputs"
      outputs: "Expected outputs"
    tasks:
      - "Task 1"
      - "Task 2"
  # Repeat for each additional required capability

  tasks:
    - name: "Task 1"
      description: "Description of Task 1"
