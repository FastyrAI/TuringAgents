    "context": "The Division of Kooyong is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria.  The Division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 75 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election.  It covers an area of approximately 52 km2 in the inner-east suburbs of Melbourne.  It is named after the suburb of Kooyong, on which it was originally based.  However, Kooyong has not been in its namesake electorate for some time, being instead in neighbouring Higgins.  Nonetheless, the seat has retained the name of Kooyong, primarily because the Australian Electoral Commission's guidelines on electoral redistributions require it to preserve the names of original electorates where possible. The Division of Hindmarsh is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the western suburbs of Adelaide.  The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was split on 2 October 1903, and was first contested at the 1903 election, though on vastly different boundaries.  The Division is named after Sir John Hindmarsh, who was Governor of South Australia 1836-38.  The 78 km² seat extends from the coast in the west to South Road in the east, covering the suburbs of Ascot Park, Brooklyn Park, Edwardstown, Fulham, Glenelg, Grange, Henley Beach, Kidman Park, Kurralta Park, Morphettville, Plympton, Richmond, Semaphore Park, Torrensville, West Beach and West Lakes.  The international Adelaide Airport is centrally located in the electorate making noise pollution a prominent local issue, besides the aged care needs of the relatively elderly population − the seat has one of the highest proportions of citizens over the age of 65 in Australia.  Progressive boundary redistributions over many decades transformed Hindmarsh from a safe Labor seat in to a marginal seat often won by the government of the day. The Division of South Australia was an Australian Electoral Division covering South Australia.  The seven-member statewide seat existed from the inaugural 1901 election until the 1903 election.  Each elector cast seven votes.  Unlike most of the other states, South Australia had not been split into individual single-member electorates.  The other exception was the five-member Division of Tasmania.  The statewide seats were abolished at a redistribution conducted two months prior to the 1903 election and were subsequently replaced with single-member divisions, one per displaced member, with each elector now casting a single vote. The Division of Grey is an Australian electoral division in South Australia.  The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Sir George Grey, who was Governor of South Australia from 1841–45 (and later Prime Minister of New Zealand). The Division of Adelaide is an Australian electoral division in South Australia and is named for the city of Adelaide, South Australia's capital.  The 76 km² seat is centred on the Adelaide city centre and spans from Grand Junction Road in the north to Cross Road in the south and from Portrush Road in the east to South Road in the west, taking in suburbs including Ashford, Clarence Park, Enfield, Goodwood, Kent Town, Keswick, Kilburn, Maylands, Northgate, Norwood, Parkside, Prospect, Rose Park, St Peters, Toorak Gardens, Unley and Walkerville. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the federal independent agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising federal elections and referendums.  State and local government elections are overseen by separate Electoral Commissions in each state and territory: New South Wales elections are conducted by the New South Wales Electoral Commission, in Queensland it is the Electoral Commission of Queensland; in Victoria it is the Victorian Electoral Commission; in South Australia it is the Electoral Commission of South Australia; in Tasmania it is the Tasmanian Electoral Commission; in Western Australia it is the Western Australian Electoral Commission; in the Northern Territory it is the Northern Territory Electoral Commission and in the Australian Capital Territory it is the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Commission. The Division of Moreton is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland.  The division was one of the original 75 divisions contested at the first federal election.  It is named after Moreton Bay, and originally stretched from southern Brisbane all the way to the Gold Coast.  While successive redistributions have left the seat completely landlocked, it has nonetheless retained the name of Moreton, mainly because the Australian Electoral Commission's guidelines on electoral redistributions require it to preserve the names of original electorates where possible. The Division of Maribyrnong is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria.  It is located in the inner north-western suburbs of Melbourne.  It covers the suburbs of Aberfeldie, Airport West, Avondale Heights, Braybrook, Essendon, Kealba, Keilor East, Maribyrnong, Moonee Ponds, Niddrie, St. Albans and Sunshine North.  Due to redistributions, the division has been slowly moving west.  It originally covered the suburbs of Footscray and North Melbourne.  According to the 2011 census, Maribyrnong has the highest proportion of Catholics in any Commonwealth Electoral Division in Australia with 41.6% of the population. Edwardstown is an inner southern-western suburb located 6 km southwest of Adelaide in the City of Marion. The Division of McMillan is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria.  It is located in the western part of the Gippsland region, which extends for the length of Victoria's eastern Bass Strait coastline.  It includes the outer south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Pakenham, and also includes the towns of Warragul, Moe, Wonthaggi, Leongatha and Foster.  It stretches from Mount Baw Baw and the Baw Baw National Park in the north to Wilsons Promontory, and the Wilsons Promontory National Park in the south.  It is the southernmost Electoral Division in continental Australia.",

    "context": "Sandalpur is a village in the Araria district in Bihar.  The two primary religions in Sandalpur are Muslim and Hindu.  Muslims belong to Shershahwadi cast, this cast is in OBC category.  Hindus belong to Rajput and Harijon.  Villagers are farmers. In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.  Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting).  An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.  New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall. A category mistake, or category error, or categorical mistake, or mistake of category, is a semantic or ontological error in which things belonging to a particular category are presented as if they belong to a different category, or, alternatively, a property is ascribed to a thing that could not possibly have that property.  An example is the metaphor \"time crawled\", which if taken literally is not just false but a category mistake.  To show that a category mistake has been committed one must typically show that once the phenomenon in question is properly understood, it becomes clear that the claim being made about it could not possibly be true. In human social affairs, discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong rather than on individual attributes.  This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, \"in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated\".  It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making. German wine regions are classified according to the quality category that the wine falls into - \"Tafelwein, Landwein, Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete\" (QbA) and \"Prädikatswein\".  The wine regions allowed to produce QbA and Prädikatswein are further subdivided into four categories, in descending order of size - \"Anbaugebiet\" (a major wine region), \"Bereich\" (a district within the wine region), \"Großlage\" (a collection of vineyards within a district) and \"Einzellage\" (a single vineyard).  A small number \"Einzellagen\" do not belong to a \"Großlage\" and are called \"großlagenfrei\", but all belong to a Bereich and Anbaugebiet. The extremely poor people having annual income less than Rs.1.00 lakh and who do not belong to any social category such as SC/ST/OBC, have been categorized as Economically Backward Classes (EBCs). In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a subcategory formula_1 of a category formula_2 is said to be isomorphism closed or replete if every formula_2-isomorphism formula_4 with formula_5 belongs to formula_6 This implies that both formula_7 and formula_8 belong to formula_1 as well. In category theory, a subobject classifier is a special object Ω of a category; intuitively, the subobjects of an object \"X\" correspond to the morphisms from \"X\" to Ω.  As the name suggests, what a subobject classifier does is to identify/classify subobjects of a given object according to which elements belong to the subobject in question.  Because of this role, the subobject classifier is also referred to as the \"truth value object\".  In fact, the way in which the subobject classifier classifies subobjects of a given object is by assigning the values true to elements belonging to the subobject in question, and false to elements not belonging to the subobject.  This is why the subobject classifier is widely used in the categorical description of logic. Bauhinia is a genus of more than 500 species of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae of the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution.

The Democratic national ticket was led by incumbent President Bill Clinton, and his running mate, incumbent Vice President Al Gore.  The Republican nominee for President was Bob Dole, the former Republican Leader of the United States Senate and long-time Senator from Kansas who was previously the vice-presidential running mate of President Gerald Ford in 1976, following Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's retirement from politics that year.  Dole's running mate for Vice President was Jack Kemp, a former NFL football player and the Housing Secretary under George H. W. Bush.  Businessman Ross Perot ran as candidate for the Reform Party with economist Pat Choate as his running mate; he received less media attention and was excluded from the presidential debates and, while still obtaining substantial results for a third-party candidate, by U.S. standards, did not renew his success of the 1992 election.  Turnout was registered at 49.0%, the lowest for a presidential election since 1924. The United States presidential election of 1972, the 47th quadrennial presidential election was held on Tuesday, November 7, 1972.  The Democratic Party’s nomination was eventually won by Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, who ran an anti-war campaign against Republican incumbent President Richard Nixon, but was handicapped by his outsider status, limited support from his own party, the perception of many voters that he was a left-wing extremist and the scandal that resulted from the withdrawal of vice-presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton. Robert Skinner Boyd (born January 11, 1928) is an American journalist who spent most of his career working for the Knight Newspaper Group, spending two decades as the group's Washington bureau chief.  He and Clark Hoyt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for uncovering the fact that Senator Thomas Eagleton, George McGovern's choice for vice president, had had severe psychiatric problems and undergone three shock treatments.  Instead of publishing their scoop, they disclosed their findings to McGovern's top advisor, and Eagleton withdrew as the Democratic nominee.

His second candidacy for the Presidency of the United States, he had previously run for his party's nomination in the 2000 primaries and was considered as a potential running mate for his party's nominee, then-Governor George W. Bush of Texas.  After winning a majority of delegates in the Republican primaries of 2008, on August 29, leading up to the convention, McCain selected Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate for Vice President.  Five days later, at the 2008 Republican National Convention, McCain was formally selected as the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 2008 presidential election. The 1992 vice-presidential debate was part of the 1992 presidential election.  The participants were Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Al Gore from Tennessee; Ross Perot's running mate, retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale; and Republican candidate, incumbent Vice President Dan Quayle.

He served as Mayor of Clark, New Jersey and as a Union County Freeholder.  Maguire was elected to the State Assembly in 1975, running with future Governor Donald DiFrancesco; they defeated incumbent Democrat Betty Wilson and her running mate, William A. Wolf, the Rahway Democratic Municipal Chairman.  He was re-elected in 1977.  Following the resignation of State Senator Peter J. McDonough in 1979, Maguire ran for the State Senate, but lost a vote of a Republican convention to DiFrancesco.  He was re-elected to the Assembly, with future Congressman Bob Franks as his running mate.  Maguire's political career came to an end in 1981, when redistricting traded Democratic towns in Union County for solid Republican towns in Essex County.  DiFrancesco was facing a primary challenge from an Essex County Republican; to secure the Essex organization line in a district where Republican primary election voters were evenly split between Essex and Union, DiFrancesco agreed to put an Essex Republican on his ticket.  John Renna, the Essex Republican Chairman, preferred that Franks (who had worked on Renna's 1977 bid for County Chairman), get the second Assembly seat.  Maguire, replaced by Millburn Mayor Maureen Ogden, did not run for re-election.

Clark's argument for her position in the Civil Rights Movement was one that claimed \"knowledge could empower marginalized groups in ways that formal legal equality couldn't.\" \"We Shall Overcome\" is a gospel song which became a protest song and a key anthem of the Civil Rights Movement.  The song is most commonly attributed as having descended lyrically from \"I'll Overcome Some Day\", a hymn by Charles Albert Tindley that was first published in 1900. \"Marching Song of the First Arkansas Colored Regiment\" is one of the few Civil War-era songs inspired by the lyrical structure of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and the tune of \"John Brown's Body\" that is still performed and recorded today.  The \"Marching Song\" has been described as \"a powerful early statement of black pride, militancy, and desire for full equality, revealing the aspirations of black soldiers for Reconstruction as well as anticipating the spirit of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\"  The song's lyrics are attributed to the regiment's white officer, Captain Lindley Miller.  An almost identical song, \"The Valiant Soldiers,\" is attributed to Sojourner Truth in post-Civil War editions of her \"Narrative\".  Recent scholarship supports Miller as the original author, or at least compiler, of the “Marching Song.” \"O Sanctissima \" (O most holy) is a Roman Catholic hymn in Latin, seeking the prayers of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and often sung in various languages on her feast days.  The earliest known publication was from London in 1792, presenting it as a traditional song from Sicily; but no original source or date has been confirmed for the simple melody or the poetic text.  The tune is often called \"Sicilian Mariners Hymn\" or similar titles, referring to the seafarers' nightly invocation of Mary as their maternal protector: Our Lady, Star of the Sea.  The tune has been notably reused for the German Christmas carol \"O du fröhliche\" (O, how joyful), the English recessional hymn \"Lord, Dismiss Us With Thy Blessing\", and the first half of the American civil rights anthem \"We Shall Overcome\". The American Civil Rights Institute is a non-profit organization located in Sacramento, California founded by Ward Connerly and Thomas L. \"Dusty\" Rhodes in opposition to racial and gender preferences.  The organization describes itself as \"a national civil rights organization created to educate the public on the harms of racial and gender preferences.\"  The American Civil Rights Institute also known as The American Civil Right Coalition wasn't fully formed until 1997, in order to take the battle against affirmative action nationwide. \"Solidarity Forever\", written by Ralph Chaplin in 1915, is perhaps the most famous union anthem.  It is sung to the tune of \"John Brown's Body\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".  Although it was written as a song for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), other union movements, such as the AFL-CIO, have adopted the song as their own.  The song has been performed by musicians such as Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, and was redone by Emcee Lynx and The Nightwatchman.  It is still commonly sung at union meetings and rallies in the United States, Australia and Canada, and has also been sung at conferences of the Australian Labor Party and the Canadian New Democratic Party.  This may have also inspired the hymn of the consumer cooperative movement, \"The Battle Hymn of Cooperation\", which is sung to the same tune.",

    "context": "Tritrichomonas foetus is a species of single-celled flagellated parasites that is known to be a pathogen of the bovine reproductive tract as well as the intestinal tract of cats.  In cattle, the organism is transmitted to the female vagina and uterus from the foreskin of the bull where the parasite is known to reside.  It causes infertility, and, at times, has caused spontaneous abortions in the first trimester.  In the last ten years, there have been reports of \"Tritrichomonas foetus\" in the feces of young cats that have diarrhea and live in households with multiple cats. Paramphistomatidae is a family of flukes which are parasitic on herbivorous mammals, and sometimes humans.  All members are obligate parasites requiring a mammalian host and snails for completion of their life cycle.  The adult worms are found in the intestinal tract and liver.  The body is characterised by leaf-like fleshy structure with a large posterior sucker. Telorchis is a genus of trematode parasites found in many herps, comprising around 70 species.  This parasite is an indirect parasite, with a snail intermediate host and a reptile or amphibian definitive host.  Typically found in the gastrointestinal tract of their definitive host, telorchids attach to the wall of the intestinal tract with their oral sucker. Tritrichomonas is a genus of single celled flagellated parasitic excavates, some of whose species are known to be pathogens of the bovine reproductive tract as well as the intestinal tract of felines. Klossiella is a genus of parasitic alveolates of the phylum Apicomplexa.  Species in this genus infect the renal tract of mammals and intestinal tract of snakes. The biological family Felidae is a lineage of carnivorans that includes the cats.  A member of this family is also called a felid.  The characteristic features of cats have evolved to support a carnivorous lifestyle, with adaptations for ambush or stalking and short pursuit hunting.  They have gracile and muscular bodies, strong flexible forelimbs and retractable claws for holding prey, dental and cranial adaptations for a strong bite, and often have characteristic striped or spotted coat patterns for camouflage.  Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they are dependent on nutrients in animal flesh for survival, and because of the large proportion of meat in their diet are sometimes referred to as hypercarnivores. Of the 13 terrestrial families in the order Carnivora, they are the strictest carnivores. Clostridium is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, which includes several significant human pathogens, including the causative agent of botulism and an important cause of diarrhea, \"Clostridium difficile\".  They are obligate anaerobes capable of producing endospores.  The normal, reproducing cells of \"Clostridium\", called the vegetative form, are rod-shaped, which gives them their name, from the Greek κλωστήρ or spindle.  \"Clostridium\" endospores have a distinct bowling pin or bottle shape, distinguishing them from other bacterial endospores, which are usually ovoid in shape.  \"Clostridium\" species inhabit soils and the intestinal tract of animals, including humans.  \"Clostridium\" is a normal inhabitant of the healthy lower reproductive tract of women. Selenococcidium is a genus of parasitic alveolates in the phylum Apicomplexa.  There is one recognised species in this genus - \"Selenococcidium intermedium\".  This species infects the intestinal tract of European lobsters (\"Homarus gammarus\"). The altered Schaedler flora (ASF) is a community of eight bacterial species: two Lactobacilli, one Bacteroides, one spiral bacteria of the Flexistipes genus, and four extremely oxygen sensitive (EOS) Fusobacterium species.  The bacteria are selected for their dominance and persistence in the normal microflora of mice, and for their ability to be isolated and grown in laboratory settings.  Germ-free animals, mainly mice, are infected with ASF for the purpose of studying the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Intestinal commensal bacteria play an important role in affecting gene expression of the GI tract, immune responses, nutrient absorption, and pathogen resistance.  The standardized microbial cocktail enabled the controlled study of microbe and host interactions, role of microbes, pathogen effects, and intestinal immunity and disease association, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.  Also, compared to germfree animals, ASF mice have fully developed immune system, resistance to opportunistic pathogens, and normal GI function and health, and are a great representation of normal mice Cryptosporidium parvum is one of several species that cause cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic disease of the mammalian intestinal tract.",

    "context": "Chasewater is a reservoir located in the parish of Burntwood and the district of Lichfield in Staffordshire, England.  Originally known as Norton Pool and Cannock Chase Reservoir, it was created as a canal feeder reservoir in 1797.  The reservoir was created to directly supply the Wyrley and Essington Canal and maintain levels in the 160-mile Birmingham Canal Network.  During a period of great industrial growth in the Black Country region the maintenance of water levels in canal infrastructure was essential and Chasewater was in great demand.  As canals became less essential for transport of goods during the mid-20th century, the reservoir diversified and became a popular public amenity with activities such as water-skiing, sailing, wakeboarding and cycling.  Chasewater is the third largest reservoir by volume in the county of Staffordshire and the largest canal feeder reservoir in the West Midlands. The Magdeburg Water Bridge (German: \"Kanalbrücke Magdeburg\" ) is a large navigable aqueduct in central Germany, located near Magdeburg.  The largest canal underbridge in Europe, it spans the river Elbe and directly connects the Mittellandkanal to the west and Elbe-Havel Canal to the east of the river, allowing large commercial ships to pass between the Rhineland and Berlin without having to descend into and then climb out of the Elbe itself. CSS \"Raleigh\" was originally a small, iron-hulled, propeller-driven towing steamer operating on the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal.  She was taken over by the State of North Carolina in May 1861, and transferred to the Confederate States the following July.  Her commanding officer during 1861–1862 was Lieutenant Joseph W. Alexander.  Her entire service was in coastal waters of North Carolina and Virginia and in the James River as part of the James River Squadron. Isham Randolph (March 25, 1848 in Clarke County, Virginia – August 5, 1920) was an American civil engineer who is best known as the chief engineer of the Sanitary District of Chicago during the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.  Randolph had no formal engineering training, he began his career as a railroad axeman.  After completing the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, at the time the largest canal in the world, Randolph became a consulting engineer on the Panama Canal at the request of the Roosevelt Administration. The Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act was a law passed by the Indiana General Assembly and signed by Whig Governor Noah Noble in 1836 that greatly expanded the state's program of internal improvements.  It added $10 million to spending and funded several projects, including turnpikes, canals, and later, railroads.  The following year the state economy was adversely affected by the Panic of 1837 and the overall project ended in a near total disaster for the state, which narrowly avoided total bankruptcy from the debt.  By 1841, the government could no longer make even the interest payment, and all the projects, except the largest canal, were handed over to the state's London creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in debt.  Again in 1846, the last project was handed over for another 50% reduction in the debt.  Of the eight projects in the measure, none were completed by the state and only two were finished by the creditors who took them over. The second USS \"Oneida\" was a screw sloop-of-war in the United States Navy.  During the Civil War, she destroyed the CSS \"Governor Moore\" and served in blockade operations.  She was attached to the Asiatic Squadron from 1867–1870.  She sank in 1870 outside Yokohama, Japan after collision with the British steamer \"Bombay\".  The Court of Inquiry found the officers of \"Oneida\" were responsible for the collision.  \"Bombay's\" captain was blamed for not staying at the scene to render assistance - a decision that caused some controversy.  Japanese fishing boats saved 61 sailors but 125 men lost their lives.  The American government made no attempt to raise the wreck and sold it to a Japanese wrecking company.  The company recovered many bones from the wreck and interred them at their own expense.

Charles Carroll Simms (1824–1884) a native of Virginia, became a United States Navy midshipman in 1839.  He served in the U.S. Navy for more than two decades, achieving the rank of Lieutenant in 1854.  He was dismissed from the service in April 1861, after his state left the United States, and briefly was an officer in Virginia's Navy.  Commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy in June 1861, during that year he commanded the steamer CSS \"George Page\" and was assigned to the steamer CSS \"Rappahannock\".  Also commanded CSS Appomattox in coastal North Carolina until it was scuttled in February 1862.  As an officer of the ironclad CSS \"Virginia\", he took part in her March–May 1862 actions in the vicinity of Hampton Roads.  Subsequently, he served in the gunboats CSS \"Nansemond\" on the James River, and CSS \"Selma\" in Mobile Bay.  During the American Civil War's final year, while assigned to the Mobile Squadron, he commanded the ironclads CSS \"Baltic\" and CSS \"Nashville\".  First Lieutenant Simms surrendered to Federal forces in early May 1865 and was paroled soon afterwards. CSS Bombshell — believed to have been an Erie Canal steamer — was a U.S. Army transport.  \"Bombshell\" was sunk by the Confederate batteries in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina on April 18, 1864.  She was raised by the Confederate forces and taken into the Confederate States Navy under the command of Lieutenant Albert Gallatin Hudgins, CSN.  \"Bombshell\" was captured at the Battle of Albemarle Sound by USS \"Mattabesett\" and USS \"Sassacus\" on May 5, 1864 and sent to New York City. The Erie Canal is a canal in New York that is part of the east–west, cross-state route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal).  Originally, it ran 363 mi from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie.  It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.  When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States. The Indira Gandhi Canal is one of the largest canal projects in India.  It starts from the Harike Barrage at Harike, a few kilometers below the confluence of the Satluj and Beas rivers in the Indian state of Punjab and terminates in irrigation facilities in the Thar Desert in the north west of Rajasthan state.  Previously known as the Rajasthan Canal, it was renamed the Indira Gandhi Canal in 1985 following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.",

    "context": "The M5 is a motorway in England linking the Midlands and the South West.  It runs from Junction 8 of the M6 at West Bromwich near Birmingham to Exeter in Devon.  Heading south-west, the M5 runs east of West Bromwich and west of Birmingham through Sandwell Valley.  It continues past Bromsgrove (and from Birmingham and Bromsgrove is part of the Birmingham Motorway Box), Droitwich Spa, Worcester, Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Bristol, Weston-super-Mare, Bridgwater and Taunton on its way to Exeter, ending at Junction 31.  It is the primary gateway to South West England.  Congestion is common during the summer holidays, on Friday afternoons, and school and bank holidays on the section south of the M4. The M6 motorway (Irish: \"Mótarbhealach M6\" ) is a motorway in Ireland, which runs (together with the M4) from Dublin to Galway.  The M6 extends from its junction with the M4 at Kinnegad all the way west to the outskirts of Galway City, but the Athlone bypass and the approach to Galway city - while of dual carriageway standard - have not been designated motorway and are still signed as N6.  The motorway was officially completed and opened to traffic on 18 December 2009, and was the first city-to-city direct major inter-urban route to be completed in Ireland.  The M6 and M4, which form the Galway-Dublin route, consist of a grade-separated 2+2 dual carriageway road with a top speed limit of 120 km/h.  At approximately 144 km (90 mi), the M6 is the third longest motorway in the state. Preston Patrick is a village and civil parish in South Lakeland, Cumbria, England.  It has junction 36 of the M6 motorway in its south west corner and extends north east on both sides of the motorway until just beyond the B2564 road.  In the 2011 census its population was reported to be 426.  The neighbouring parishes are Old Hutton and Holmescales to the north, Lupton to the east, Beetham to the south and Preston Richard to the west. Sir James Drake CBE (27 July 1907 – 1 February 1989) was a chartered civil engineer who is regarded as the pioneer of the national motorway network in the United Kingdom.  As the County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council from 1945 to 1972 he led teams that designed the first stretch of motorway opened to the public, the Preston By-pass (now the M6 from Junctions 29 to 32) on 5 December 1958.  There then followed numerous contracts to extend the motorway in the north west of England, which, thanks to his role, probably still has the greatest density of motorways in the country.  He was appointed a CBE in 1962 for his services as County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council and in 1973 he was knighted in recognition of his role as head of the North West Road Construction Unit and the Lancashire Sub-Unit, organisations that further extended his initial work. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. The A601(M) is a motorway in Lancashire, England.  It is 1.3 mi long, and meets the M6 at Junction 35.  It is a unique motorway within the United Kingdom as it has a dual carriageway section leading north from Junction 35 of the M6, with a single carriageway section (the only single carriageway section with motorway status in the United Kingdom) leading south, where it terminates at a T junction on a B road.  The A601(M) is not the A601 under motorway restrictions, as is the usual explanation for such a classification in the UK.  The A601 itself is the Derby inner ring road, over 100 mi away. The A7 is a major trunk road in the United Kingdom, that runs south from Edinburgh in Central Scotland to Carlisle in North West England.  The A7 meets the M6 motorway close to Carlisle, which runs south to the north west, Midlands and south of England.  However, the A702 road, which runs further to the north east, and the A74 (M) south, provide a quicker alternative and serve as the main link between Edinburgh and the M6. The M61 is a motorway in North West England.  It runs from the M60 motorway northwest of Manchester and heads northwest past Bolton and Chorley to join the M6 just north of the junction between the M6 and M65 motorways to the south of Preston. The M23 is a motorway in the United Kingdom.  The motorway runs from south of Hooley in Surrey, where it splits from the A23, to Pease Pottage, south of Crawley in West Sussex where it rejoins the A23.  The northern end of the motorway starts at junction 7 on what is effectively a 2 mi spur north from junction 7 of the M25 motorway (junction 8 on the M23).  From Hooley it runs for 17 mi past Redhill, Gatwick Airport and Crawley.  A spur runs from junction 9 to Gatwick Airport. The M65 is a motorway in Lancashire, England.  It runs from just south of Preston through the major junction of the M6 and M61 motorways, east past Darwen, Blackburn, Accrington, Burnley, Nelson and ends at Colne.",

National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players.  The draft lottery took place on May 20, 2014.  The Cleveland Cavaliers won the draft lottery to earn the first overall pick in the draft; this is the fourth number-one pick for Cleveland since 2003 and third number-one pick over a four-year span from 2011–2014.  This draft would also be the first for the reborn Charlotte Hornets, who played as the Bobcats from 2004–2014, since 2001, when the original Charlotte Hornets last selected as the Charlotte Hornets before moving to New Orleans and eventually becoming the current New Orleans Pelicans. The 2015–16 Philadelphia 76ers season was the 77th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  It was also the second straight season that Joel Embiid, their third pick in the 2014 NBA draft, would not suit up for the 76ers due to a leg injury.  Philadelphia broke the record for the longest losing streak in American professional sports history with 27 straight losses over this season and last season with a 114–116 loss to the Houston Rockets.  The losing streak would reach to 28 games (with the 18 straight losses tying the record for longest opening season losing streak with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets) before getting their first victory at home against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was also Kobe Bryant's last game against the 76ers in Philadelphia.  Philadelphia would also hire former Phoenix Suns owner, coach, general manager, and four-time NBA Executive of the Year winner Jerry Colangelo on December 7, 2015 as their Chairman of Basketball Operations.  Eleven days later, former Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, and Los Angeles Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni would join the team as an associate head coach.  Near the end of the season, general manager Sam Hinkie would announce his resignation from his position, being replaced by Jerry's son Bryan Colangelo before the end of the season.  Jerry would also announce his personal demotion from his original position afterwards.  They finished just one game shy of tying the NBA record for most losses in a season set by themselves during their 1972–73 season when they went 9–73.  However, it would be the season where Sam Hinkie's goal of \"The Process\" came into full fruition since they'd later earn the #1 selection in the 2016 NBA draft. Joel Hans Embiid ( ; born 16 March 1994) is a Cameroonian professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  After one year of college basketball at the University of Kansas, he was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the 76ers.  He has nicknamed himself \"The Process\" in response to a refrain from 76ers fans during the Sam Hinkie-era to \"trust the process\". This is a history of the Philadelphia 76ers.  The Philadelphia 76ers are an American basketball team currently playing in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The 76ers are third in NBA history in wins and playoff appearances. The Philadelphia 76ers are an American professional basketball team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  They are a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  Formerly known as the Syracuse Nationals, the 76ers joined the NBA when it was founded in 1949.  The Nationals had a record of 51–13 in their first NBA season under coach Al Cervi and won the Eastern Division crown.  The franchise were purchased by Philadelphian Irv Kosloff and Ike Richma in the spring of 1963; the NBA approved their franchise shift on May 22 and name change to the Philadelphia 76ers on August 6.  This brought professional basketball back to the city, which had been without a team since the Golden State Warriors left Philadelphia in 1962.  After coaching the 76ers since , Doug Collins resigned as head coach on April 18, 2013 following the 2012–13 season.  Brett Brown was hired to be the head coach of the 76ers on August 15, 2013 prior to the start of the 2013-14 season. The 1997–98 NBA season was the Pistons' 50th season in the National Basketball Association, and 41st season in the city of Detroit.  Despite signing free agents Brian Williams and Malik Sealy during the offseason, the Pistons got off to a slow start with a 6–11 record as Joe Dumars missed ten games due to hamstring and shoulder injuries.  In late December, they traded Theo Ratliff and Aaron McKie to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jerry Stackhouse and Eric Montross.  At midseason, head coach Doug Collins was fired after a 21–24 start, and was replaced with Alvin Gentry.  Collins would later on get a job as color analyst for the \"NBA on NBC\".  Despite another stellar season from Grant Hill, who was selected for the 1998 NBA All-Star Game, the Pistons missed the playoffs finishing sixth in the Central Division with a 37–45 record.  Following the season, Sealy signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Grant Long re-signed with the Atlanta Hawks, and Rick Mahorn re-signed with the Philadelphia 76ers.

The Atlanta Hawks won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Chicago Bulls were awarded the second pick.  The Hawks then traded the first pick to the Houston Rockets before the draft.  The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season.  The New York Knicks forfeited their first-round draft pick due to their illegal signing of George McGinnis whose rights were held by the Philadelphia 76ers.  The 76ers, the Golden State Warriors and the Buffalo Braves also forfeited their second, third and fourth-round pick respectively due to their participation in 1975 supplementary draft American Basketball Association (ABA) players who had never been drafted in the NBA.

Before the draft, 26 college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \"hardship\" rule.  13 of them withdrew before the draft, leaving only 13 early entry candidates eligible for selection.  These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.  The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 173 players.  On August 8, 1976, the league also hosted a Dispersal draft for ABA players from the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis, who were not included in the ABA–NBA merger. The 1973 NBA draft was the 27th annual draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The draft was held on April 24 and May 5, 1973, before the 1973–74 season.

A sample chapter was released on November 28, 2011.  The hardcover version was released on January 17, 2012, and the paperback was released on January 29, 2013.

Ender in Exile is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, part of the \"Ender's Game\" series, published on November 11, 2008.  It takes place between the two award-winning novels: \"Ender's Game\" and \"Speaker for the Dead\".  It could also be considered a parallel novel to the first three sequels in the Shadow Saga, since the entirety of this \"trilogy\" takes place in the span of \"Ender in Exile\".  The novel concludes a dangling story line of the Shadow Saga, while it makes several references to events that take place during the Shadow Saga.  From yet another perspective, the novel expands (or \"replaces\") the last chapter of the original novel \"Ender's Game\".  On the one hand, it fills the gap right before the last chapter, and on the other hand, it fills the gap between the last chapter and the original (first) sequel (both named \"Speaker for the Dead\").  \"Ender in Exile\" begins one year after Ender has won the bugger war, and begins with the short story \"Ender's Homecoming\" from Card's webzine Intergalactic Medicine Show.  Other short stories that were published elsewhere are included as chapters of the novel. Ender's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card.  Set in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled mankind after two conflicts with the \"buggers\", an insectoid alien species.  In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Ender Wiggin, are trained from a very young age through increasingly difficult games including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed. Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin is a fictional character from Orson Scott Card's 1985 science fiction novel \"Ender's Game\" and its sequels (\"Speaker for the Dead\", \"Xenocide\", \"Children of the Mind\", \"Ender in Exile\"), as well as in the first part of the spin-off series, \"Ender's Shadow\".  The book series itself is an expansion, with some changes to detail, of Card's 1977 short story \"Ender's Game.\" Rasputin is the title of an as-yet uncompleted science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card and Kathryn H. Kidd.  It will be the second novel in The Mayflower Trilogy.  It is currently listed as a work in progress on Card's website.  The first novel, \"Lovelock\", was published in 1994. Speaker for the Dead is a 1986 science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card and an indirect sequel to the novel \"Ender's Game\".  The book takes place around the year 5270, some 3,000 years after the events in \"Ender's Game\".  However, because of relativistic space travel, Ender himself is only about 25 years older. Orson Scott Card (born August 24, 1951) is an American novelist, critic, public speaker, essayist, and columnist.  He writes in several genres but is known best for science fiction.  His novel \"Ender's Game\" (1985) and its sequel \"Speaker for the Dead\" (1986) both won Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Card the only author to win both science fiction's top U.S. prizes in consecutive years.  A feature film adaptation of \"Ender's Game\", which Card co-produced, was released in late October 2013 in Europe and on November 1, 2013, in North America.

    "context": "David McWane (born November 18, 1976) is an American musician, writer, and filmmaker, best known as the lead singer of Boston-based ska punk band Big D and the Kids Table.  He has published several books of poetry and has written short stories and screenplays that are public on his website. Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed by bassist Steve Harris in 1975.  The band's first album, 1980's \"Iron Maiden\", was written primarily by Harris, with vocalist Paul Di'Anno co-writing two tracks and guitarist Dave Murray contributing \"Charlotte the Harlot\".  The 1981 follow-up, \"Killers\", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, \"Killers\" (the North American bonus track \"Twilight Zone\" was credited to Harris and Murray).  Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of \"Killers\", although he did not contribute any songwriting to \"The Number of the Beast\", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith.  \"The Number of the Beast\" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of \"Run to the Hills\", which charted at number seven on its release.  It was not until 1983's \"Piece of Mind\" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith.  The Dickinson and Smith-penned \"Flight of Icarus\" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart.

Killers Live at the Whiskey is a live album by the former Iron Maiden singer Paul Di'Anno and his band Killers.  The album was apparently recorded at the Whisky a Go Go club in Los Angeles however it is suspected that it was recorded in the studio with crowd noise mixed in the recording.

The album contain songs from Di'Anno's solo career and four songs from his back catalogue with Iron Maiden. Iron Maiden are a British heavy metal band formed in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris.  After several lineup changes prior to their recording career, they settled on Harris, vocalist Paul Di'Anno, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Doug Sampson.  The band released an EP as a four-piece, before hiring guitarist Dennis Stratton in 1979.  Doug Sampson was dismissed from the band as he was unable to cope with the touring schedule and, at the suggestion of Stratton, replaced by Clive Burr, with whom the band recorded their self-titled debut album in 1980.  Later that year, Stratton was replaced by guitarist Adrian Smith, due to musical and personal differences brought about by choosing not to travel with the band when supporting Kiss on the European leg of their Unmasked Tour. Live at the Rainbow is the first live video recorded by Iron Maiden on 21 December 1980 and released in 1981.  It includes one of the band's earliest concerts with guitarist Adrian Smith as well as a very early version of \"Killers\", with lyrics that differ from the album version that would be released in 1981.

Originally, the supergroup was to contain David Coverdale, John Entwistle and Cozy Powell, but this line-up \"wasn't working out\", according to Di Anno.  He also insisted that he hated the finished product and that he \"only did it for the money\". Di'Anno was a band featuring former Iron Maiden singer Paul Di'Anno, whom the band was named after. \"Purgatory\" is Iron Maiden's fifth single, released on 15 June 1981, and would be their last with singer Paul Di'Anno.

The single was reissued in 1990, on the same CD and 12\" vinyl as the EP \"Maiden Japan\", in the \"First Ten Years\" box set.

Open Problems in Mathematics is a book, edited by John Forbes Nash Jr. and Michael Th.  Rassias, published in 2016 by Springer ().  The book consists of seventeen expository articles, written by outstanding researchers, on some of the central open problems in the field of mathematics.  The book also features an Introduction on \"John Nash: Theorems and Ideas\", by Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov.  According to the editors’ Preface, each article is devoted to one open problem or a “constellation of related problems”. Boris (Boaz) Avraamovich Trakhtenbrot (Russian: Борис Авраамович Трахтенброт ; 19 February 1921 – 19 September 2016), or Boaz (Boris) Trakhtenbrot (Hebrew: בועז טרכטנברוט‎ ‎ ) was an Israeli and Russian mathematician in mathematical logic, algorithms, theory of computation, and cybernetics.  Trakhtenbrot was born in Brichevo, northern Bessarabia.  He worked at Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk during the 1960s and 1970s. Richard Lawrence Bishop (born 1932) is an American mathematician, a professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  The Bishop–Gromov inequality in Riemannian geometry is named after him (with Mikhail Gromov). Mikhail Leonidovich Slonimsky (Russian: Михаи́л Леони́дович Слони́мский ; 1 August [O.S. 20 July] 1897 – 8 October 1972) was a Soviet writer, member of the Serapion Brothers group. In mathematics, the Gromov product is a concept in the theory of metric spaces named after the mathematician Mikhail Gromov.  The Gromov product can also be used to define \"δ\"-hyperbolic metric spaces in the sense of Gromov. In logic, finite model theory, and computability theory, Trakhtenbrot's theorem (due to Boris Trakhtenbrot) states that the problem of validity in first-order logic on the class of all finite models is undecidable.  In fact, the class of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable (though it is co-recursively enumerable). Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov (also Mikhael Gromov, Michael Gromov or Mischa Gromov; Russian: Михаи́л Леони́дович Гро́мов ; born 23 December 1943), is a French-Russian mathematician known for work in geometry, analysis and group theory.  He is a permanent member of IHÉS in France and a Professor of Mathematics at New York University. The non-squeezing theorem, also called \"Gromov's non-squeezing theorem\", is one of the most important theorems in symplectic geometry.  It was first proven in 1985 by Mikhail Gromov.

It is set in the fictional Danish town of Korsbæk between 1929 and 1947.  It follows the lives of a range of characters from across the social spectrum, focusing specifically on the rivalry between the families of two businessmen: The banker Hans Christian Varnæs, an established local worthy, and social climber Mads (Andersen-)Skjern, who arrives in town as the series opens.  The name \"Matador\" was taken from , also the series' tentative English title.  In addition, in contemporary Danish a \"matador\" is often used to describe a business tycoon, in the series referring to the character of Mads Skjern and his craftiness as a self-made entrepreneur. Gideon Planish is a 1943 novel by American writer Sinclair Lewis.

Keeping Up Appearances is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC, centred on the life of eccentric and snobbish middle class social climber Hyacinth Bucket, who insists that her surname is pronounced \"Bouquet\".  The sitcom follows Hyacinth in her attempts to prove her social superiority and to gain standing with those she considers upper class; attempts that are constantly hampered by her decidedly lower class extended family whom she desperately seeks to hide.  Much of the humour comes from the culture clash between Hyacinth's vision of herself and the reality of her working-class background, plus the farcical situations in which she finds herself as she battles to protect her social credibility. Rebecca or Becky Sharp is the main character of William Makepeace Thackeray's satirical novel \"Vanity Fair\" (1847–48).

She befriends Amelia at an expensive girls school where she is given a place because Becky's father teaches there, and uses her as a stepping stone to gain social position.  Sharp functions as a \"picara\"—a picaresque heroine—or by being a social outsider who is able to expose the manners of the upper gentry to ridicule.

John Black is a fictional character from \"Days of Our Lives\", an American soap opera on the NBC network.  He has been played by actor Drake Hogestyn since 1986, with a break in between from January 2009 to September 2011.  John was created by script writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina and Leah Laiman as The Pawn in 1985 and introduced by executive producers Betty Corday and Al Rabin.  John becomes one of \"Days of Our Lives' \" most popular characters when he is revealed to be the presumed dead Roman Brady (Wayne Northrop) with plastic surgery and amnesia.  However, Northrop's return in 1991 led to Hogestyn's Roman being retconned into the entirely separate character of John Black, which also establishes the supercouple pairing of John and Marlena, due to John's affair with Roman's wife, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).  During the time in which he believes he is Roman, John picks up the mantle of Roman's feud with the notorious international criminal Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo).  John and Stefano's feud is central to the character's history as Stefano is partly responsible for John's memory loss.  Their lives are further intertwined in 2008 when the two are falsely led to believe they are half brothers—a story that was later disproved.  Hogestyn's portrayal has made him one of daytime's most popular and recognizable stars.  Hogestyn was attributed with helping the series out of its ratings slump in the 1980s.

On October 5, 2014 a 19-year-old man named Opti Mudarov went to the town hall where an event was taking place to mark Grozny City Day celebrations coinciding with the birthday of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov.  Police officers noticed him acting strangely and stopped him.  The officers began to search him and the bomb which Mudarov had been carrying exploded.  Five officers, along with the suicide bomber, were killed, while 12 others were wounded. Aslan (Khalid) Aliyevich Maskhadov (Chechen: Аслан Али кӏант Масхадан, Aslan Ali-khant Masxadaŋ, Russian: Аслан Алиевич Масхадов) (21 September 1951 – 8 March 2005) was a leader of the Chechen independence movement and the third President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Akhmed Halidovich Zakayev (Chechen: Заки Хьалид кlант Ахьмад, Zaki Halid-khant Ahmad , Russian: Ахмед Халидович Закаев, Akhmed Khalidovich Zakayev ; born 26 April 1959) is a former Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister of the unrecognised Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI).  He was also the Foreign Minister of the Ichkerian government, appointed by Aslan Maskhadov shortly after his 1997 election, and again in 2006 by Abdul Halim Sadulayev.  During the First Chechen war Zakayev took part in the battles for Grozny and other military operations, as well as in high-level negotiations with the Russian side. The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria ( ; Chechen: \"Nóxçiyn Paçẋalq Içkeri\" ], Cyrillic: Нохчийн Пачхьалкх Ичкери; Russian: Чеченская Республика Ичкерия ; abbreviated as \"ChRI\" or \"CRI\") is the unrecognized secessionist government of the Chechen Republic.  The republic was proclaimed in late 1991 by Dzhokhar Dudayev, and fought two devastating wars with the Russian Federation, which denounced the secession.  In late 2007, the President of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov, declared that he had renamed the republic to Noxçiyc̈ó and converted it into a province of the much larger Caucasus Emirate, with himself as Emir.  This change was rejected by some members of the former Chechen government-in-exile. Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov (Russian: Рамза́н Ахма́тович Кады́ров ; ] , Chechen: Къадар Ахьмат-кIант Рамзан, \"Q̇adar Aẋmat-khant Ramzan\" ; born 5 October 1976) is the Head of the Chechen Republic and a former member of the Chechen independence movement. The 2004 Grozny stadium bombing occurred on 9 May 2004 when a bomb exploded in the Dynamo stadium in the Chechen capital, Grozny, killing 10 people including the republic's president Akhmad Kadyrov and another 100 people were wounded.  Kadyrov's election was considered by many to be by a fraudulent vote.  The explosion was caused by a bomb planted underneath the concrete floor of the VIP podium and occurred at 10:35am during a parade and concert in Groznyy celebrating the 59th anniversary of the victory of Germany in World War 2.  The blast tore a hole in the section designated for dignitaries.  It was not clear if the explosion was specifically targeting Kadyrov or whether it would have occurred regardless of his presence, as he was not officially scheduled to be at this event.  Khussein Isayev, chairman of the Republic's state council, and Adlan Khasanov, a reported for Reuters, were also killed in the blast.  Col. Gen. Valery Baranov, the commander of the Russian military in the northern Caucasus was gravely wounded.  Although estimates of total casualties varied, at least ten people were killed and around fifty more injured.  The numbers include many civilians and WW2 veterans who were also attending the celebrations.  Officials believe that the blast was detonated by remote control and was intentionally installed below the VIP section.  The bomb may have been planted some time ago during the recent renovations to the stadium.  Preliminary reports suggest that the bomb was equivalent to one ton of TNT.  The location of the bomb made it impossible for existing equipment to detect.  The type of explosive appeared identical to one used to blow up the military parade two years ago in the Dagestani city of Kaspiysk.  Rescue workers prevented two other blasts in the stadium.  They were able to defuse another landmine and an additional explosive device equipped with a timer set to go off 30 minutes after the first explosion.

The attack was conducted by armed formations of the Chechen opposition council with a clandestine support of Russian federal armor and aircraft on 26 November 1994.  The fighting subdued after the first 10 hours, but some clashes continued until the following day.

He is the primary antagonist of King's eight-volume \"Dark Tower\" series, as well as the novels \"Insomnia\" and \"Black House\".  Described as \"Gan's crazy side\", the Crimson King is the ultimate ruler of the Red (also called the Random and the Outer Dark), and the archetypal embodiment of evil in Stephen King's fictional multiverse.  His goal is to topple the Dark Tower which serves as the linchpin of time and space, destroying the multitude of universes which revolve around it so that he can rule in the primordial chaos which follows. East Derry, also known as the Upper Village, is an unincorporated community in the town of Derry in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.  The village center constitutes the East Derry Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is located on a hill close to the geographic center of the town of Derry along East Derry Road, approximately 2 mi east of the built-up town center of Derry.  East Derry has a separate ZIP code (03041) from the rest of the town of Derry.  Alan Shepard lived in the village as a boy.  Station #4 of the Derry Fire Department is located in the village. The Maiden City Festival (Ulster-Scots: tha \"Maiden Citie Blythe-Tid\") takes place in Derry, Northern Ireland in the second week in August each year.  In 2008 the Festival was described as a \"diverse, varied programme of events that underscores the organisers' desire to provide something for everyone\", as well as a \"showcase for Protestant tolerance and openness\".  Events included Bluegrass on the Walls, Children's Heritage Visual Art Workshops, drumming events, including some with members of the north west's African community, music of all kinds at the Verbal Arts Centre, Foyle Ulster Scots Highland Gathering, firwework display, the fifth Annual Scottish Dance Competition, historical walks and talks, with the finale being the Relief of Derry Pageant (the Apprentice Boys of Derry 319th Relief of Derry Celebrations) on 9 August 2008.  The Festival commemorates the actions of Protestant Apprentice Boys who shut the city gates against the forces of the Catholic King James in December 1688.  King James laid siege to the city from December to August 1689 until the Protestant forces of William of Orange relieved the city. It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King.  It was his 22nd book and 18th novel written under his own name.  The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by a being that exploits the fears and phobias of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey.  \"It\" primarily appears in the form of a clown to attract its preferred prey of young children. Derry is a fictional town and a part of Stephen King's fictional Maine topography.  Derry has served as the setting for a number of his novels, novellas, and short stories.  Derry first appeared in King's 1981 short story \"The Bird and the Album\" and has reappeared as late as his 2011 novel \"11/22/63\" (see list below).  Derry is said to be near Bangor, but King has acknowledged that Derry is actually his portrayal of Bangor.  A map on King's official website, though, places Derry in the vicinity of the town of Etna. Jerusalem's Lot, Maine (often shortened to 'Salem's Lot or just the Lot) is a fictional town and a part of writer Stephen King's fictional Maine topography.  'Salem's Lot has served as the setting for a number of his novels, novellas, and short stories.  'Salem's Lot first appeared in King's 1975 novel \"'Salem's Lot\", and has reappeared as late as his 2013 novel \"Doctor Sleep\" (see list below).  The town is described as being located in Cumberland County, between (or including parts of) the towns of Falmouth, Windham, and Cumberland, near the southern part of the state about ten miles north of Portland.  A map on King's official website, though, places 'Salem's Lot considerably further north, approximately in Northwest Piscataquis. Rose Madder is a fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1995.  It deals with the effects of domestic violence (which King had touched upon before in the novels \"It\", \"Insomnia\", \"Dolores Claiborne\", \"Needful Things\", and many others) and, unusually for a King novel, relies for its fantastic element on Greek mythology.  In his memoir, \"\", King states that \"Rose Madder\" and \"Insomnia\" are \"stiff, trying-too-hard novels.\" Carrie is a novel by American author Stephen King.  It was his first published novel, released on April 5, 1974, with an approximate first print-run of 30,000 copies.  Set primarily in the then-future year of 1979, it revolves around the eponymous Carrie White, a misfit and bullied high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her, while in the process causing one of the worst local disasters in American history.  King has commented that he finds the work to be \"raw\" and \"with a surprising power to hurt and horrify.\"  It is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools.  Much of the book uses newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her sadistic classmates and her own mother Margaret. Insomnia is a horror/fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King, first published in 1994.  Like \"It\" and \"Dreamcatcher\", its setting is the fictional town of Derry, Maine.  The original hardcover edition was issued with dust jackets in two complementary designs.  The first is pictured on the right; the second has the white and red colors reversed.  In his memoir, \"\", King states that \"Insomnia\" and \"Rose Madder\" are \"stiff, trying-too-hard novels.” According to books by Tyson Blue (\"The Unseen King\"), Stephen J. Spignesi (\"The Lost Work of Stephen King\"), and Rocky Wood \"et al.\" (\"Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished\"), there are numerous unpublished works by Stephen King that have come to light throughout King's career.  These allegedly include novels and short stories, most of which remain unfinished.  Most are stored among Stephen King's papers in the special collections of the Raymond H. Fogler Library at the University of Maine, some of which are freely accessible to the library's visitors.  However, others require King's permission to read.  Additionally, there are a number of uncollected short stories, published throughout King's long career in various anthologies and periodicals, that have never been published in a King collection.",

Oklahoma defeated FSU 13–2 in a defensive battle to claim the National Championship as head coach Bob Stoops completed just his second season as the coach of the Sooners.  The game was part of the 2000–2001 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) of the 2000 NCAA Division I-A football season and represented the concluding game of the season for both teams.  The Orange Bowl was first played in 1935, and the 2001 game represented the 67th edition.  The contest was televised in the United States on ABC. The 2005 Orange Bowl was the BCS National Championship Game of the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football season and was played on January 4, 2005 at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.  The game matched the USC Trojans against the Oklahoma Sooners.  Both teams entered with undefeated, 12–0 records.  The Trojans defeated the Sooners by a score of 55–19, led by quarterback Matt Leinart.  ESPN named Leinart's performance as one of the top-10 performances in the first ten years of the BCS system. The 2009 FedEx BCS National Championship Game was an American football game played at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on January 8, 2009.  It was the national championship game for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season, and featured the second-ranked Florida Gators against the top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners.  The two participants were determined by the BCS Rankings to decide the BCS National Championship.  Television coverage in the United States was provided by Fox, and radio coverage by ESPN Radio.  The game was the last BCS Championship to air on Fox; starting with the 2010 game, ABC or ESPN televised the championship. The 2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team represented the University of Oklahoma in the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season, the 114th season of Sooner football.  The team was led by two-time Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award winner, Bob Stoops, in his 10th season as head coach.  They played their homes games at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Oklahoma.  They were a charter member of the Big 12 Conference The Oregon Ducks college football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), representing the University of Oregon in the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12).  Since the establishment of the team in 1893, Oregon has appeared in 25 bowl games. Included in these games are 8 combined appearances in the traditional \"big four\" bowl games (the Rose, Sugar, Cotton, and Orange) and 3 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game appearances, including one in the BCS National Championship Game.  Through the history of the program, 7 separate coaches have led the Ducks to bowl games with Mike Bellotti having the most appearances with 12.  From 2009 to 2012, Chip Kelly was Oregon's head coach, and led the Ducks to BCS bowl appearances in each of his four seasons at Oregon.  After losses in both the 2010 Rose Bowl and the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, Kelly led the Ducks to a victory in the 2012 Rose Bowl over Wisconsin and in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl over Kansas State.  Oregon's overall bowl record is 13 wins and 17 losses. The 2009 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl game was a post-season college football bowl game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Texas Longhorns on Monday, January 5, 2009, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  Texas participated in the Fiesta Bowl because the Big 12 champion University of Oklahoma Sooners were participating in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game; however the bowl kept its ties to the Big 12 by selecting the Longhorns, who did not play in the championship game as they beat Oklahoma in the Red River Rivalry, 45-35, then lost to Texas Tech and Texas Tech in turn lost to Oklahoma and dictated that a tiebreaker would decide that the highest BCS ranked team for the Big 12 South the week of November 28, 2008 would be in the title game.  The Buckeyes were chosen as an at-large school as co-champions of the Big Ten Conference, having lost the right to play in the Rose Bowl due to a 13-6 loss to Penn State on October 25. The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) was a selection system designed, through polls and computer statistics, to determine a No. 1 and No. 2 ranked team in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).  After the final polls, the two top teams were chosen to play in the BCS National Championship Game which determined the BCS national champion team, but not the champion team for independent voting systems (most notably the AP Poll).  This format was intended to be \"bowl-centered\" rather than a traditional playoff system, since numerous FBS Conferences have expressed their unwillingness to participate in a play-off system.  However, due to the unique and often esoteric nature of the BCS format, there had been controversy as to which two teams should play for the national championship and which teams should play in the four other BCS bowl games (Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Sugar Bowl).  In this selection process, the BCS was often criticized for conference favoritism, its inequality of access for teams in non-Automatic Qualifying (non-AQ) Conferences (most likely due to perceived strength of schedule), and perceived monopolistic, \"profit-centered\" motives.  In terms of this last concern, Congress has explored the possibility on more than one occasion of holding hearings to determine the legality of the BCS under the terms of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and the United States Justice Department has also periodically announced interest in investigating the BCS for similar reasons. The 2003 LSU Tigers football team represented Louisiana State University (LSU) during the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season.  Coached by Nick Saban, the LSU Tigers played their home games at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The Tigers compiled an 11–1 regular season record and then defeated the No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game, Afterward, LSU was invited to play the Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national title.  LSU won the BCS National Championship Game, the first national football championship for LSU since 1958. The 1999 Fiesta Bowl, the designated BCS National Championship Game for the 1998 season, was played on January 4, 1999, in Tempe, Arizona at Sun Devil Stadium.  The teams were the Tennessee Volunteers and Florida State Seminoles.  Tennessee entered the contest undefeated and number one in the major polls.  Florida State sophomore QB Chris Weinke was injured in Florida State's final ACC game of the regular season and did not participate in the championship game.  Ultimately, Tennessee won their sixth National Championship after a gap of forty-seven years by beating the Seminoles by a score of 23–16.  The game was the first BCS National Championship. The 2004 USC Trojans football team represented the University of Southern California in the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football season.  Although now vacated for breaking NCAA rules, the team won the 2004 BCS National Championship by winning the 2005 Orange Bowl, that year's BCS National Championship Game.  The team also won the AP title for the second year in a row.  It was the Trojans' first undisputed national championship since 1972, and the second time a team had gone wire-to-wire, with the Trojans holding the number 1 spot in the polls all season.

Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s.  The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.  The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The first comic strips based on \"The Simpsons\" appeared in 1991 in the magazine \"Simpsons Illustrated\" (not to be confused with the comic publications from 2012 bearing the same name), which was a companion magazine to the show.  The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book entitled \"Simpsons Comics and Stories\", containing three different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans.  The book was a success and due to this, the creator of \"The Simpsons\", Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics.  By the end of 1993, Bongo was publishing four titles: \"Simpsons Comics\", \"Bartman\", \"Radioactive Man\" and \"Itchy & Scratchy Comics\".

They had a record of 2 wins, 5 losses and 1 tie.  The team played its home games at Chicago's Wrigley Field (then called Cubs Park) and was the first NFL team to do so.  The Tigers were never formally members of the APFA.  However, since the team played seven games against APFA teams in 1920, resulting in a 1–5–1 league record, they are generally included in the league standings. The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri.  The Chiefs compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division.  The team was founded in 1960 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) (they are not associated with an earlier Dallas Texans NFL team that only played for one season in 1952).  In 1963, the team relocated to Kansas City and assumed their current name.  The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970.  The team is valued at just under $1 billion. The Buffalo Bills are a professional American football team based in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area.  The Bills compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division.  The team plays their home games at New Era Field in Orchard Park, New York.  The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of New York (the New York Giants and New York Jets play at MetLife Stadium, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey).  The Bills conduct summer training camp at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, New York, an eastern suburb of Rochester, New York. The Brooklyn Dodgers were an American football team that played in the National Football League from 1930 to 1943, and in 1944 as the Brooklyn Tigers.  The team played its home games at Ebbets Field of the baseball National League's team, the Brooklyn Dodgers.  In 1945, because of financial difficulties and the increasing scarcity of major league-level players because of the war-time defense requirements at the height of World War II, the team was merged with the Boston Yanks and were known as the Yanks for that season.  This old NFL franchise was not related to the earlier (second incarnation) American Football League II with a franchise that played as the Brooklyn Tigers for the first half of the 1936 season before moving to Rochester, New York and playing as the Rochester Tigers.  Another NFL team that played in the Brooklyn borough was the Brooklyn Lions (which became the Brooklyn Horsemen after merging with a team from an earlier first incarnation AFL of the same name) in 1926.  Later co-owner and partner Dan Topping (1912–1974), pulled the Tigers team out of the old NFL in 1946 and placed it in the newly established rival professional league – the All-America Football Conference, which shortly lasted until 1949 until several stronger teams from the AAFC merged with and entered a reorganized NFL in 1950.  It lasted until 1970 with the NFL-AFL (third) merger following the establishment of the first \"Super Bowl\" inter-league national championship game three years before with the old NFL champions playing the victors of the latest rival fourth incarnation of the American Football League IV, formed in 1960 (now the American Football Conference (AFC). The Dallas Texans played in the National Football League (NFL) for one season, 1952, with a record of 1–11.  The team is considered one of the worst teams in NFL history, both on (lowest franchise winning percentage) and off the field.  The team was based first in Dallas, then Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Akron, Ohio, during its only season.  The Texans were the last NFL team to fold.  Many players on the 1952 roster went to the new Baltimore Colts franchise in 1953.  The American Football League (AFL) had a 1960 charter member named the Dallas Texans (who later became the Kansas City Chiefs), but the AFL Texans have no relationship with the earlier NFL team. The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.  The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division.  The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and plays its home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, which opened for the 2009 season.  The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season.  The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in .  The team's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs.  The Cowboys' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games (home and away) began in 2002.  The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history, just behind the New England Patriots record nine Super Bowl appearances.  This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships, most in the NFC.  The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances, tying them with their NFC rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, and the AFC's Patriots; all three are second to Pittsburgh's record six Super Bowl championships.  The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons (1966–85), in which they only missed the playoffs twice (1974 and 1984), an NFL record that remains unchallenged. The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The Indianapolis Colts are a professional American football team based in Indianapolis, Indiana.  They are a member of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL).  In 1953, a Baltimore-based group led by Carroll Rosenbloom won the rights to a new Baltimore franchise.  Rosenbloom was granted an NFL team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct Dallas Texans organization.  The team was known as the Baltimore Colts for 31 seasons before moving to Indianapolis in March 1984. The 1946 NFL season was the 27th regular season of the National Football League.  Before the season, Elmer Layden resigned as NFL Commissioner and Bert Bell, co-founder of the Philadelphia Eagles, replaced him.  Meanwhile, the All-America Football Conference was formed to rival the NFL, and the Rams became the first NFL team based on the West Coast after they relocated from Cleveland, Ohio, to Los Angeles, California.  A regular season game was played on Tuesday, the last until the 2010 season, on October 1, between New York and Boston.

    "context": "The Folsom South Canal is an aqueduct in Northern California in the United States.  The canal diverts water from the American River at Nimbus Dam in Sacramento County and travels about 26.7 mi in a southerly direction, terminating near Clay, about 10 mi northeast of Lodi.  The canal is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as part of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit of the Central Valley Project.  It is contracted for irrigation, industrial and municipal water supply; formerly it provided cooling water for the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station.  It is also connected to the Mokelumne Aqueduct, which provides a large portion of the San Francisco Bay Area's water supply. The Whiting Refinery is an oil refinery located on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan and the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal and operated by BP.  The facility is primarily located in Whiting, Indiana, USA, though portions of the 1400 acre complex span into the neighboring cities of Hammond and East Chicago. The Port of Manchester was a port in North West England, until its closure in 1982.  It was created as a customs port on 1 January 1894, four months before the official opening of the Manchester Ship Canal.  It extended along the whole 36 mi length of the ship canal, from Eastham in the west to Manchester in the east, absorbing the Port of Runcorn, which had been created in 1862.  The creation of the new port moved the Port of Liverpool's boundary 11 mi to the west.  The ship canal transformed Manchester from a landlocked city into a major sea port, at its height the third-busiest port in the United Kingdom.  Once delivered to the port goods could be transported to other parts of the country such as Leeds to the east, and up to 100 mi south as far as Birmingham. I-Pass (stylized as I-PASS) is the electronic toll collection system utilized by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) on its toll highways that launched on November 18, 1993, with the opening of Interstate 355 (Veterans Memorial Tollway).  It uses the same transponder as the E-ZPass system used in the Northeastern US and the Indiana Toll Road, along with the future Indiana State Road 912 (Cline Avenue) Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal bridge. The Chicago, Indiana and Southern Railroad (reporting mark CI&S) is a defunct railroad which operated in the states of Illinois and Indiana during the early 20th century.  The CI&S formed in 1906 from the consolidation of the two other railroads: the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad and the Indiana Harbor Railroad.  The new railroad also owned the capital stock of the Danville and Indiana Harbor Railroad.  The stock of the new company itself was wholly owned by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, both of which were part of the New York Central system.  A 1907 report called the CI&S a \"tributary to the Lake Shore.\"  The railroad operated two lines: a north-south line between Indiana Harbor (East Chicago, Indiana) and Danville, Illinois, and a line from the Spring Valley coalfields at Seatonville, Illinois, to South Bend, Indiana.  Together the two lines controlled 301 mi of track.  In 1914 the CI&S was one of several railroads consolidated to form the modern New York Central Railroad. The Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light is an active aid to navigation that marks the end of a breakwater on the east side of the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal where it enters Lake Michigan. Manchester Ship Canal Police (also known as Manchester Dock Police and the Port of Manchester Police) was a police force in the United Kingdom that was responsible for policing the Manchester Ship Canal.  It was maintained by the Manchester Ship Canal Company between 26 December 1893, when the canal opened, and 31 January 1993. The Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal is an artificial waterway on the southwest shore of Lake Michigan, in East Chicago, Indiana which connects the Grand Calumet River to Lake Michigan.  It consists of two branch canals, the 1.25 mile (2 km) Lake George Branch and the 2 mile (3 km) long Grand Calumet River Branch which join to form the main Indiana Harbor Canal.  The Indiana Harbor Canal also functions as a harbor and runs 1.4 miles (2 km) before reaching the Indiana Harbor which connects to Lake Michigan.  In 2002, Indiana Harbor was the 45th busiest harbor in the United States, handling almost 13,300,000 short tons (12,000,000 metric tons) of cargo.  Foreign trade accounted for only 500,000 short tons (450,000 metric tons) of that.  Indiana Harbor is not a state-managed harbor, and it is maintained by the Chicago District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1913. The Grand Calumet River is a 13.0 mi river that flows primarily into Lake Michigan.  Originating in Miller Beach in Gary, it flows through the cities of Gary, East Chicago and Hammond, as well as Calumet City and Burnham on the Illinois side.  The majority of the river's flow drains into Lake Michigan via the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, sending about 1500 cuft per second of water into the lake.  A smaller part of the flow, at the river's western end, enters the Calumet River and ultimately drains into the Illinois and ultimately the Mississippi River. Rancho Seco Recreational Park is a recreational area located in the California Central Valley near the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station in Herald, California.  It is open to the public for camping, fishing, hiking and water activities.  Boats are restricted to outboard electric motors which improves the lake's use as a swimming hole.  The lake is fed by the Folsom South Canal.",

Unlike later drafts, this draft was unique because there were three different stages in which teams built their rosters.  First on January 22, 1997, the Initial Player Allocation draft took place in which 16 players were assigned to each team in no particular order.  The elite draft portion comprised professional women's basketball players who had competed in other leagues, usually international leagues.  On February 27, 1997, an elite draft added two more players to each team.  On April 28, 1997, the four rounds of the regular WNBA draft took place.

    "context": "Day One is a made-for-TV documentary-drama movie about The Manhattan Project, the research and development of the atomic bomb during World War II.  It is based on the book by Peter Wyden.  The movie was written by David W. Rintels and directed by Joseph Sargent.  It starred Brian Dennehy as General Leslie Groves, David Strathairn as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and Michael Tucker as Dr. Leo Szilard.  It premiered in the United States on March 5, 1989 on the CBS network.  It won the 1989 Emmy award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special.  The movie received critical acclaim for its historical accuracy despite being a drama. Good Night, and Good Luck is a 2005 American historical drama film directed by George Clooney and starring David Strathairn, George Clooney, Robert Downey, Jr., Patricia Clarkson and Jeff Daniels.  The movie was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov (both of whom also have acting roles in the film) and portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2005.  Twenty-five years in the making, the book was awarded the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.  It also won the 2008 Duff Cooper Prize, Chicago Tribune Best Book of the Year, and \"Discover Magazine\" Best Science Book of the Year. Julius Robert Oppenheimer (April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.  Oppenheimer was the wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory and is among those who are credited with being the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for their role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity test in New Mexico; Oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from the \"Bhagavad Gita\": \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" Fat Man and Little Boy (a.k.a. Shadow Makers in the UK) is a 1989 film that reenacts the Manhattan Project, the secret Allied endeavor to develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II.  The film is named after the weapons \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\" that were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively.  The code names, originally Fat Man and Thin Man, were drawn from characters in the works of Dashiell Hammett.  However, there's a possible secondary allusion to stout project director Gen. Leslie Groves and the slim scientific director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.  The film focuses much attention on the frequently strained relationship between the two men. The J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize and Medal was awarded by the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, from 1969.  Established in memory of US physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the award consisted of a medal, certificate and a $1000 honorarium.  It was awarded for \"outstanding contributions to the theoretical natural sciences [...] during the preceding decade\". The Oppenheimer security hearing was a 1954 proceeding by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American scientist who had headed the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, where he played a key part in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb.  The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's Q clearance being revoked.  This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist McCarthyism. The uranium hydride bomb was a variant design of the atomic bomb that was first suggested by Robert Oppenheimer in 1939 and advocated and tested by Edward Teller.  It used deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, as a neutron moderator in a U235-deuterium compound.  The chain reaction is a slow nuclear fission (see neutron temperature).  Bomb efficiency is very adversely affected by the cooling of neutrons since it delays the reaction. The Day After Trinity (a.k.a.  The Day After Trinity: J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb) is a 1980 documentary film directed and produced by Jon H. Else in association with KTEH public television in San Jose, California.  The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), the theoretical physicist who led the effort to build the first atomic bomb, tested in July 1945 at Trinity site in New Mexico.  Featuring candid interviews with several Manhattan Project scientists, as well as newly declassified archival footage, \"The Day After Trinity\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature of 1980, and received a Peabody Award in 1981. George Aristotle Economou (June 24, 1923 – April 2, 2003) was an American optical systems expert, who helped set up special cameras to photograph and study the first test of the atomic bomb in 1945.  He was instrumental in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, working on the Manhattan Project under scientific director Robert Oppenheimer.",

He was childless and on his death in 1968 the line of the second Baronet failed.  He was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the seventh Baronet.  He was the eldest son of Edward Geoffrey Antrobus, second son of John Coutts Antrobus, son of the aforementioned Gibbs Antrobus, younger brother of the second Baronet.  As of 2008 the title is held by the seventh Baronet's eldest son, the eighth Baronet, who succeeded in 1995.  He lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. Brother Mathias Barrett (1900–1990) was a Catholic Brother born in Ireland who founded a number of homes to help serve the needy and homeless throughout North America.

Petter Halfdan Rudolf Fredrik Olsen (born 7 February 1948) is a Norwegian businessman, billionaire and member of the Olsen shipping family, who own Fred.  Olsen & Co. He is the younger brother of the current leader of the company, Fredrik Olsen.  Petter Olsen formerly owned one of the four versions of Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" (1895), one of the world's most iconic works of art.  The older brother, Fredrik Olsen, had been involved in a legal process against his younger brother concerning \"The Scream\" and other Munch works that had been collected by their father, Thomas Fredrik Olsen.  According to the will of their mother, Henriette, the collection was to be left to the younger son.  Fredrik Olsen disputed the will but lost the case in the Oslo District Court in 2001.  Petter Olsen's version of \"The Scream\" was sold on 2 May 2012, selling for an auction record price of US$119.9 million, including fees and commission.  Petter Olsen sold the painting to raise funds to build a museum in Hvitsten, Norway, where Munch once owned property and near where Olsen has an estate, to house the rest of his father's collection. The Boreel, later Boreel Baronetcy, of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, is a title in the Baronetage of England.  It was created on 21 March 1645 for William Boreel.

    "context": "Pennsylvania Route 162 (PA 162) is a 10.1 mi state highway in southeast Pennsylvania.  The western terminus of the route is at the PA 82/PA 82 in Unionville, Chester County.  The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.)  in West Chester.  PA 162 is known as Embreeville Road from its western terminus to the village of Embreeville and Telegraph Road from Embreeville to an intersection with the Strasburg Road one mile (1.6 km) west of Marshallton.  At this point, the route turns east, following the Strasburg Road to US 322 Bus.  in West Chester.  The portion of road between Marshallton and West Chester follows the 17th-century \"Great Minquas Path\" and became part of the Strasburg Road linking Strasburg and Philadelphia in the 1770s.  PA 162 was designated onto its current alignment by 1930. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks (, Russian: Путь из варяг в греки, \"Put' iz varjag v greki\" , Swedish: \"Vägen från varjagerna till grekerna\" , Greek: Εμπορική Οδός Βαράγγων – Ελλήνων ) was a medieval trade route that connected Scandinavia, Kievan Rus' and the Eastern Roman Empire.  The route allowed traders along its length to establish a direct prosperous trade with the Empire, and prompted some of them to settle in the territories of present-day Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.  The majority of the route comprised a long-distance waterway, including the Baltic Sea, several rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea, and rivers of the Dnieper river system, with portages on the drainage divides.  An alternative route was along the Dniestr river with stops on the Western shore of Black Sea.  These more specific sub-routes are sometimes referred to as the Dnieper trade route and Dniestr trade route, respectively. The Rennsteig Cycle Path (German: \"Rennsteig-Radwanderweg\" ) follows for 195 km the Rennsteig trail that has existed at least since the Middle Ages as a courier and trade route.  Most of this long distance cycle path is carefully ballasted, although parts of it also run along quiet country lanes.  On the crest of the Thuringian Highland the cycle path is identical for long stretches with the hiking trail of the same name, but departs from it in places so that steep inclines can be avoided.  It starts at Hörschel west of Eisenach and ends in Blankenstein by the River Saale. A trade route is a logistical network identified as a series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo.  The term can also be used to refer to trade over bodies of water.  Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes.  Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade.  Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route.  During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent. Great Minquas Path (or The Great Trail) was a 17th-century trade route that ran through southeastern Pennsylvania from the Susquehanna River, near Conestoga, to the Schuylkill River, opposite Philadelphia.  The 80-mile (130 km) east-west trail was the primary route for fur trading with the Minquas (or Susquehannock) people.  Dutch, Swedish and English settlers fought one another for control of it. In the Middle Ages, the Volga trade route connected Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia with the Caspian Sea, via the Volga River.  The Rus used this route to trade with Muslim countries on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as Baghdad.  The route functioned concurrently with the Dnieper trade route, better known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, and lost its importance in the 11th century. The Eselsweg (English: \"donkey trail\") is a long-distance hiking trail that follows an ancient trade route through the \"Mittelgebirge\" Spessart, in the states of Hesse and Bavaria, Germany.  It is 111 km long and leads from Schlüchtern in the valley of the Kinzig river to Großheubach on the river Main.  The trail follows an ancient trade route on which donkey caravans used to transport salt, thus giving rise to the name. The Susquehanna River ( ; Lenape: Siskëwahane) is a major river located in the northeastern United States.  At 464 mi long, it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States that drains into the Atlantic Ocean, via the Chesapeake Bay.  With its watershed, it is the 16th-largest river in the United States, and the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic. The Trapper's Trail is a north-south path along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains that links the Great Platte River Road at Fort Laramie and the Santa Fe Trail at Bent's Old Fort.  Along this path there were a number of trading posts, also called trading forts.  It was an important trade route for animal trappers and fur traders in the North American fur trade from about 1820-1846. The Birkenhainer Strasse (English: \"Birkenhainer road\") is a long-distance hiking trail that follows an ancient trade route through the \"Mittelgebirge\" Spessart, in the states of Hesse and Bavaria, Germany.  It is 71 km long and leads from Hanau to Gemünden am Main, cutting across the so-called \"Mainviereck\", a large loop of the river Main.  The trail follows an ancient trade route which in the Middle Ages was an important road for moving troops and for long-distance trade.  The \"Birkenhainer Strasse\" was a part of the link between Nuremberg and Antwerp.  Its origins may lie back as far as the Neolithic period.  The name likely derives from a prominent copse of birch trees that used to exist near the road at Geiselbach (Hesse).",

    "context": "Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae.  The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or \"cones\" of various species of \"Banksia\", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia.  Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10 mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the \"Banksia\" fruit.  The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits.  The first specimens of \"Banksiamyces\", known then as \"Tympanis toomansis\", were described in 1887.  Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, \"B. katerinae\", \"B. macrocarpus\", and \"B. toomansis\".  A fourth species, \"B. maccannii\", was added in 1984. The following is a list of some notable species of the agaric genus \"Amanita\".  This genus contains over 500 named species and varieties, but the list is far from exhaustive.  The list follows the classification of subgenera and sections of \"Amanita\" outline by Corner and Bas; Bas, as used by Tulloss (2007) and modified by Redhead & al. (2016) for \"Amanita\" subgenus \"Amanitina\" and Singer for \"Amanita\" section \"Roanokenses\".  Bolding of the species name and an asterisk (*) following indicates the species is the type species of that section, with a double asterisk (**) indicating the type species of the entire genus.  Use of common names follows Tulloss (2007), Holden (2003), Arora (1986), and Lincoff (1981). Megalurus is a genus of passerine bird in the family Locustellidae.  The genus was once placed in the Old World warbler \"wastebin\" family Sylviidae.  The genus contains six species also known as the typical grassbirds.  The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics.  The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand.  The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea.  The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands.  Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings.  Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens. The Calyptocephalellidae are a family of toads found in Chile containing two genera, \"Calyptocephalella\" and \"Telmatobufo\".  The \"Calyptocephalella\" genus contains one species, \"C. gayi\", the helmeted water toad, which is a large aquatic toad weighing up to 0.5 kg .  The \"Telmatobufo\" genus contains four species, \"T. australis\", \"T. bullocki\", \"T. ignotus\", and \"T. venustus\".  All species within the family are considered threatened, with \"T. bullocki\" and \"T. venustus\" being classified as critically endangered. Daboecia , St. Dabeoc's heath, is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, containing two evergreen shrubs, closely related to the genus \"Erica\".  They are native to cliffs and heathland in south-western Europe. Pachyornis is an extinct genus of ratites from New Zealand which belonged to the moa family.  Like all ratites it was a member of the order Struthioniformes.  The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel.  They also have a distinctive palate.  This genus contains three species, and are part of the Anomalopteryginae or lesser moa subfamily.  \"Pachyornis\" moa were the stoutest and most heavy-legged genus of the family.  The most notable species being \"Pachyornis elephantopus\" - the Heavy-Footed Moa.  They were generally similar to the Eastern Moa or the Broad-billed moa of the genus \"Euryapteryx\", but differed in having a pointed bill and being more heavyset in general.  At least one species (\"P. australis\") is assumed to have had a crest of long feathers on its head.  The species became rapidly extinct following human colonization of New Zealand, with the possible exception of \"P. australis\", which may have already been extinct by then. Geranium is a genus of 422 species of flowering annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as the cranesbills.  They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, but mostly in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.  The long, palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form.  The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple or blue, often with distinctive veining.  Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged.  Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring. Leptofoenus is a genus of wasp in the family Pteromalidae, the type genus subfamily Leptofoeninae found in South, Central, and southern North America.  The genus contains five living species and one extinct species known from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola.  With body sizes ranging from 11 - \"Leptofoenus\" species are larger than nearly all other species in Pteromalidae.  The genus bears a notable resemblance to the wasp families Pelecinidae, Gasteruptiidae, and Stephanidae. The genus \"Geranium\" contains more than 420 plant species, which are also known as cranesbill or hardy geranium (to distinguish them from \"Pelargonium\" species). Lophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae.  The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution.  Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves.  In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter.  In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens.  The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera.  Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations.  In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.",

Her work includes the Blue Heron Park Preserve in Staten Island, New York, a large nature refuge that is part of Staten Island's \"Blue Belt.\"  Bridges' designs include elements of a site's natural systems, enhancement of wildlife habitats, and also its history. Golden Gate Park, located in San Francisco, California, United States, is a large urban park consisting of 1017 acres of public grounds.  It is administered by the San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department, which began in 1871 to oversee the development of Golden Gate Park.  Configured as a rectangle, it is similar in shape but 20 percent larger than Central Park in New York, to which it is often compared.  It is over three miles (3 mi ) long east to west, and about half a mile (0.5 mi ) north to south.  With 13 million visitors annually, Golden Gate is the fifth most-visited city park in the United States after Central Park in New York City, Lincoln Park in Chicago, and Balboa and Mission Bay Parks in San Diego. The Panhandle is a park in San Francisco, California, that forms a panhandle with Golden Gate Park.  It is long and narrow, being three-quarters of a mile long and one block wide.  Fell Street borders it to the north, Oak Street to the south, and Baker Street to the east.  Only two streets run through it - Stanyan Street at the western end between it and Golden Gate Park and Masonic Avenue through the middle.  Two paved walking paths run through it from Golden Gate Park to Baker Street, one allowing bicycles.  There are basketball courts, a public restroom, and a playground in the section between Stanyan Street and Masonic Avenue. Albemarle Park is an historic district in Asheville, North Carolina.  Originally a mountain resort, it is now primarily a residential area of homes and apartments with retail and office spaces.  Much of its significance is due to the founder, railroad magnate William Greene Raoul, and his selection of three New York City based men to design his resort.  Architect Bradford Lee Gilbert designed the core buildings, including The Manor Inn, the Lodge Gate, and several cottages.  Landscape architect and author Samuel Parsons, Jr. planned the roads and romantic, naturalistic landscape.  Parsons had been the head landscape architect for the city of New York after working with Frederick Law Olmsted on Central Park.  A drainage and sewage plan was done by leading engineer George E. Waring Jr. Arthur Asahel Shurcliff (1870–1957) was a noted American landscape architect.

    "context": "State Route 66 (SR 66) is a surface road in the U.S. state of Arizona in Mohave and Coconino Counties.  In 1914, the road was designated \"National Old Trails Highway\" but in 1926 was re-designated as U.S. Route 66.  In 1985, U.S. Route 66 was dropped from the highway system.  Parts of the highway were either absorbed into I-40, turned over to the state (SR 66), or turned over to Yavapai County. U.S. Route 66 (US 66 or Route 66), also known as the Will Rogers Highway, the Main Street of America or the Mother Road, was one of the original highways within the U.S. Highway System.  US 66 was established on November 11, 1926, with road signs erected the following year.  The highway, which became one of the most famous roads in the United States, originally ran from Chicago, Illinois, through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before ending at Santa Monica, California, covering a total of 2448 mi .  It was recognized in popular culture by both the hit song \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" and the \"Route 66\" television show in the 1960s. U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66) covered 401 mi as part of a former United States Numbered Highway in the state of Arizona.  The highway ran from west to east, starting in Needles, California, through Kingman and Seligman to the New Mexico state line as part of the historic US 66 from Santa Monica, California, to Chicago, Illinois.  The highway was decommissioned in 1985, although portions remain as State Route 66 (SR 66). Interstate 66 (I-66) was a proposed Interstate Highway designated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 as the East–West TransAmerica Corridor and High Priority Corridor 3.  The United States Department of Transportation originally planned to extend the current I-66 from its western terminus at Middletown, Virginia, across the country to California.  The route west of Kansas was not favored by any of the related state highway departments, and as a result I-66 west of Wichita, Kansas, through New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California was cancelled.  Among the reasons for this were lack of interest from any of the state highway departments, and the insufficient projected traffic did not justify an Interstate, especially since many segments had no pre-existing highway.  The National Park Service was strongly opposed to building I-66 across the Death Valley National Park.  The choice for the number I-66 was a hope to capitalize on the decommissioned U.S. Route 66 (US 66).  The case for westward expansion of I-66 was started by businesspeople in Wichita.  Furthermore, there were no plans to build I-66 across the West Virginia–Virginia state line, leaving it as a non-contiguous highway.  The I-66 concept was supported in Kentucky mainly because of the efforts of Congressman Hal Rogers, however the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet completed its feasibility study in 2005 and concluded that building I-66 was too costly and of little traffic benefit with high potential environmental impact and cancelled the project in that state.  The only remaining study of I-66 was conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) under the 66 Corridor Study, a Tier 1 environmental impact study (EIS).  This study was cancelled August 6, 2015, by IDOT, and subsequently the FHWA announced the cancellation of the EIS in the Federal Register, ending the last I-66 project and therefore officially cancelling the I-66 Trans America Highway. U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66), the historic east–west US highway between Chicago, Illinois and Santa Monica, California, passed through one brief segment in the southeastern corner of Kansas.  It entered the state south of Baxter Springs and continued north until it crossed the Brush Creek, from where it turned east and left the state in Galena.  After the decertification of the highway in 1985, this road segment was numbered as US-69 (alternate) from Quapaw, Oklahoma north to Riverton, Kansas and as K-66 (Kansas highway) from Riverton east to Route 66 in Missouri.

He is a national radio producer/podcaster, biographer, and an international expert in American studies specializing in oral history, folk music, and Route 66. U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66) is a former east–west United States Numbered Highway, running from Santa Monica, California to Chicago, Illinois.  In Missouri, the highway ran from downtown St. Louis at the Mississippi River to the Kansas state line west of Joplin.  The highway was originally Route 14 from St. Louis to Joplin and Route 1F from Joplin to Kansas.  It underwent two major realignments (in the St. Louis and Joplin areas) and several lesser realignments in the cities of St. Louis, Springfield, and Joplin.  Current highways covering several miles of the former highway include Route 100, Route 366, Route 266, Route 96, and Route 66.  Interstate 44 (I-44) approximates much of US 66 between St. Louis and Springfield. Colfax Avenue is the main street that runs east–west through the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area in Colorado.  As U.S. Highway 40, it was one of two principal highways serving Denver before the Interstate Highway System was constructed.  In the local street system, it lies 15 blocks north of the zero meridian (Ellsworth Avenue, one block south of 1st Avenue), and would thus otherwise be known as 15th Avenue.  The street was named for the 19th-century politician Schuyler Colfax.  From west to east, it starts at Heritage Road in Golden as U.S. Highway 40 and the Business Route of I-70, and continues east through Lakewood and enters Denver at Sheridan Boulevard.  U.S. Highway 287 is routed along Colfax Avenue as well, which continues east through Denver and Aurora.  In the eastern outskirts of Aurora, Colfax Avenue meets I-70 and the two U.S. highways follow the I-70 route eastward; signage at Picadilly Road and frontage road the frontage road is labeled Colfax Avenue; while appearing to be interrupted at the I-70 and Colfax Avenue interchange; Colfax Avenue has signage in the complex E-470 interchange, appearing as a frontage road of I-70 on most maps; this frontage road starts just west of the Colfax Avenue and I-70 interchange, and at an interchange (I-70 Exit 292), Colfax Avenue becomes State Highway 36 and continues east from Aurora through Bennett to end at Headlight Road in Strasburg. K-66 is a 5+1/2 mi state highway in the southeastern corner of the state.  Its eastern terminus is on the Missouri state line near Galena (where it continues as Route 66), while its western terminus is at Alternate U.S. Highway 69 and U.S. Route 400 at Riverton.  This road is noteworthy in the fact that it used to be part of the famed U.S. Route 66.  After 1961, the nearby Interstate 44 offered a more direct route between Missouri and Oklahoma.  In 1985, US 66 was decommissioned nationally.  Kansas replaced the US-66 designation with K-66 on that portion of historic highway not numbered as U.S. Route 69 Alternate. State Highway 66 is a 22.7 mi long east-west state highway in Boulder and Weld counties in Colorado.  The highway extends from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains at a junction with U.S. Highway 36 southeast of Lyons, proceeding east through the northern edge of Longmont, to Platteville where it ends at U.S. Highway 85.  Although a number of western states retain their \"state highway 66\" as the decommissioned U.S. Route 66, the \"Mother Road\" did not run through Colorado, and State Highway 66 has no connection to the famed Historic Route 66.",

    "context": "The 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute was a pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine that occurred when Russian natural gas company Gazprom refused to conclude a supply contract for 2009 unless Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz paid its accumulating debts for previous gas supplies.  The dispute began in 2008 with a series of failed negotiations, and on January 1 Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.  On January 7 the dispute turned to crisis when all Russian gas flows through Ukraine were halted for 13 days, completely cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, most of which depends on Russian gas, and partially to other European countries. The Russia–Ukraine gas disputes refer to a number of disputes between Ukrainian oil and gas company Naftohaz Ukrayiny and Russian gas supplier Gazprom over natural gas supplies, prices, and debts.  These disputes have grown beyond simple business disputes into transnational political issues—involving political leaders from several countries—that threaten natural gas supplies in numerous European countries dependent on natural gas imports from Russian suppliers, which are transported through Ukraine.  Russia provides approximately a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU. OJSC \"Yukos Oil Company\" (Russian: ОАО Нефтяна́я Компа́ния Ю́КОС , ] ) was an oil and gas company based in Moscow, Russia.  Yukos was acquired from the Russian government by Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep during the controversial \"loans for shares\" auctions of the mid 1990s.  Between 1996 and 2003 Yukos became one of the biggest and most successful Russian companies, producing 20% of Russia's oil output, as much as Libya or Iraq, and Khodorkovsky became an advocate of democratization, international co-operation and Russian reform.  In October 2003 Khodorkovsky—by then the richest man in Russia and 16th richest man in the world—was arrested, and the company was forcibly broken up for alleged unpaid taxes shortly after and declared bankrupt in August 2006.  Courts in several countries later ruled that the real intent was to destroy Yukos and obtain its assets for the government, and act politically against Khodorkovsky.  In 2014 the largest arbitration award in history, $50 billion (€37,2 billion), was won by Yukos' former owners against Russia.

Incumbent Governor of Montana Ted Schwinden, who was first elected in 1980 and was re-elected in 1984, declined to seek re-election to a third term, creating an open seat.  Stan Stephens, the former President of the Montana Senate, won a close Republican primary, and advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by Thomas Lee Judge, Schwinden's predecessor as governor and the Democratic nominee.  Though the general election was hotly contested, Stephens ultimately defeated Judge, becoming the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in Montana since 1964. Paul Spyros Sarbanes (born February 3, 1933) is an American politician and attorney.  A member of the Democratic Party from Maryland he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977 and as a United States Senator from 1977 to 2007.  Sarbanes was the longest-serving senator in Maryland history until it was surpassed by Barbara Mikulski by a single day when her term ended on January 3, 2017. This period was marked by the number of casual vacancies and the filling of these vacancies was complex.  While senators were elected for a six year term, people appointed to a casual vacancy only held office until the earlier of the next election for the House of Representatives or the Senate.  Because the 1925 election was a half senate election, each state would ordinarily elect 3 senators.  NSW however had 2 additional vacancies as a result of the death of 2 senators with terms ending in 1929.  The first three elected, Cox, Duncan and Massy-Greene won the full term from 1 July 1926 to 30 June 1932, while the next two elected Abbott and Thomas won the long vacancies finishing on 30 June 1929.  Massy-Greene who had been appointed to fill one of the vacancies in 1923 ceased to be a senator between 14 November 1925 and the start of his new term on 1 July 1926.  Victoria had 1 additional vacancy, a short vacancy with the term ending in 1926.  Plain was the third senator elected and thus won both the short vacancy ending on 30 June 1926 and the full term from 1 July 1926 to 30 June 1932. The New York gubernatorial election of 2002 was an election for the state governorship held on November 5, 2002.  Governor George Pataki, the two-term Republican incumbent, ran for a third term.

He went on to defeat Carl McCall and Rochester billionaire Tom Golisano.  As of 2017, this is the most recent election in which a Republican was elected Governor of New York. The 1988 United States Senate Election in Maryland was held on November 8, 1988.  Incumbent Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes was reelected to a third term. The United States Senate election in Delaware, 1972 was held November 7, 1972.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator J. Caleb Boggs ran for a third term in the United States Senate.  Boggs faced off against Joe Biden, a New Castle County Councilman.  Though Senator Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms. The 1972 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 7, 1972.  Incumbent United States Senator Lee Metcalf, who was first elected to the Senate in 1960 and was re-elected in 1966, ran for re-election.

Following a close campaign, Metcalf managed to narrowly win re-election to his third term in the Senate over Hibbard. The 1942 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 3, 1942.  Incumbent United States Senator James E. Murray, who was first elected to the Senate in a special election in 1934 and was re-elected in 1936, ran for re-election.

Rankin, the Republican nominee and brother of representative Jeannette Rankin.

    "context": "The Janzen–Connell hypothesis is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of tree species biodiversity in tropical rainforests.  It was published independently in the early 1970s by Daniel Janzen and Joseph Connell.  According to their hypothesis, host-specific herbivores, pathogens, or other natural enemies (often referred to as predators) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree).  Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called specialists), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a stabilizing mechanism. Daniel O'Connell (Irish: \"Dónall Ó Conaill\" ; 6 August 1775 – 15 May 1847), often referred to as The Liberator or The Emancipator, was an Irish political leader in the first half of the 19th century.

Delicate Sound of Thunder is a Pink Floyd concert video taken from \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour\".  It was largely filmed during the concerts running from 19 August 1988 through 23 August 1988 at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, with some additional footage from 21–22 June 1988 at the Place d'Armes of the Château de Versailles, Versailles, France (used to provide the performance of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".  Note that the Versailles show was only used for some of the video footage.  The audio is from Nassau).  It was released on VHS and Laserdisc formats.  It has never been officially released on DVD.  Each song in common with the CD release uses the same performance (except \"Run Like Hell\" and \"On the Turning Away\", the latter of which has a different guitar solo at the end) with the audience a little higher in the mix.  The remaining three songs—\"Signs of Life\", \"On the Run\", and \"One Slip\"—all come from Nassau as well.  The two tracks from the \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" LP were recorded on 23 August 1988, while \"On the Run\" was recorded on 19 August 1988.  The determining factor in figuring out which of the remaining songs was from which night was the clothing differences, most notably which tie was being worn by Jon Carin. A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Pink Floyd from 1987 to 1989 in support of their album \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\".  The tour was the band's first since The Wall Tour in 1981, and also the first without the band's original bassist Roger Waters.  Furthermore, it was also the first tour in 10 years where people seeing Pink Floyd were treated to any other music besides \"The Wall\" album.  The band reprised the set-list and stage show of this tour for their performance at Knebworth Park in 1990. \"Learning to Fly\" is a song by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, written by David Gilmour, Anthony Moore, Bob Ezrin, and Jon Carin.

It reached number 70 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks chart in September, 1987, remaining three consecutive weeks at the top position in the autumn of the same year.  Meanwhile, the song failed to chart on the official U.K. top 40 singles charts. \"The Dogs of War\" is a song by Pink Floyd from their 1987 album, \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\".  It was the third single from the album in the US and Australia.  Live versions have an extended intro, an extended middle solo for the saxophone, a guitar and sax duel and a longer outro as compared to the album version.  The track was a minor rock radio hit in the US and reached #16 on MTV's Video Countdown in May 1988. \"Yet Another Movie\" is the sixth track, along with \"Round and Around\" on Pink Floyd's 1987 album, \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\".  It features soundbites from the film, \"Casablanca\".  Apparently, it was a demo during \"the Final Cut\" sessions but Roger Waters rejected it. A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in the UK and US in 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia.  It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright.  Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.

    "context": "Disco is a musical style originating in New York City in the early 1970s, and remained urban and largely underground until the middle of the decade when it began to emerge from America's urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques, and began making regular appearances mainstream, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio.  It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.  Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period.  Disco was popular with both men and women from many different backgrounds, with dances including The Bump (1974), The Hustle (1975). The Ice March (Russian: Ледяной походъ), also called the First Kuban Campaign (Russian: Первый кубанскiй походъ), a military withdrawal lasting from February to May 1918, was one of the defining moments in the Russian Civil War of 1917 to 1921.  Under attack by the Red Army advancing from the north, the forces of the Volunteer Army, sometimes referred to as the White Guard, began a retreat from the city of Rostov south towards the Kuban, in the hope of gaining the support of the Don Cossacks against the Bolshevik government in Moscow. Silvia Prada (b, born in León, Spain) is an artist who lives and works in New York City.  Her work as an illustrator and decorative artist is a monochromatic and geometric documentation of pop culture, capturing an at times fetishistic representation of select defining moments and iconography.  Her work was featured for the first time in The Face magazine in 2002.  She has helped shape the movement of contemporary illustration art of the past decade and contributed artwork to a number of leading arts and culture publications including The Face, Dazed & Confused, BlackBook, VMagazine, VMAN, Tokion, Candy Magazine Fanzine 137 and EY Magateen. The Good Men Project was founded in 2009 in the United States by Tom Matlack and James Houghton as a way to allow men to tell stories about the defining moments in their lives.  The hope was to spark a “national conversation” around the question of “What does it mean to be a good man?” The massacre at the Qissa Khawani Bazaar (the Storytellers Market) in Peshawar, British India (modern day Pakistan) on 23 April 1930 was one of the defining moments of the independence movement in British India.  It was the first major confrontation between British troops and non-violent demonstrators in the city.  Estimates at the time put the death toll from the shooting at between the official count at 20, and the figure of 400 dead put forth by Pakistani and Indian sources.  The gunning down of unarmed people triggered protests across British India and catapulted the newly formed \"Khudai Khidmatgar\" movement into prominence. \"Got to Be Real\" is a song by American singer Cheryl Lynn from her 1978 self-titled debut album.  The song, which was Lynn's debut single, was written by Lynn, David Paich and David Foster, and has since been called one of the defining moments in disco music. The following is a list of the American television networks and announcers who have broadcast NASCAR's annual Daytona 500 throughout the years.  Throughout its history, the Daytona 500 has been aired on all four major networks in the U.S., including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox.  In 1979, CBS covered the race live flag-to-flag for the first time.  The unprecedented broadcast was considered risky by network executives, but was a rousing success when a snowstorm blanketed much of the east coast, prompting a huge viewing audience.  An exciting and shocking finish capped off a telecast that was considered a ground-breaking moment in the history of NASCAR, and one of the defining moments that helped elevate the sport into the mainstream. The Sandline affair was a political scandal that became one of the defining moments in the history of Papua New Guinea, and particularly the conflict in Bougainville.  It brought down the government of Sir Julius Chan, and took Papua New Guinea to the verge of a military revolt.  The event was named after Sandline International, a UK-based private military company force. The Battle of Malakoff was a major battle during the Crimean War, fought between French-British forces against Russia on 8 September 1855 as a part of the Siege of Sevastopol.  The French army under General MacMahon successfully stormed the Malakoff redoubt, whereas a simultaneous British attack on the Redan to the south of the Malakoff was repulsed.  In one of the war's defining moments, the French \"zouave\" Eugène Libaut raised the French flag on the top of the Russian redoubt.  The Battle of Malakoff resulted in the fall of Sevastopol on 9 September, bringing the 11-month siege to an end.

    "context": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., doing business as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.  It was founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars.  SpaceX has since developed the Falcon launch vehicle family and the Dragon spacecraft family, which both currently deliver payloads into Earth orbit. Richard Hornsby & Sons was an engine and machinery manufacturer in Lincolnshire, England from 1828 until 1918.  The company was a pioneer in the manufacture of the oil engine developed by Herbert Akroyd Stuart, which was marketed under the \"Hornsby-Akroyd\" name.  The company developed an early track system for vehicles, selling the patent to Holt & Co. (predecessor to Caterpillar Inc.) in America.  In 1918, Richard Hornsby & Sons became a subsidiary of the neighbouring engineering firm Rustons of Lincoln, to create \"Ruston & Hornsby\". Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed four families of rocket engines — Merlin, Kestrel, Draco and SuperDraco — and is currently developing another rocket engine: Raptor. The Kestrel engine is an LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine.  The Kestrel engine was developed in the 2000s by SpaceX for upper stage use on the Falcon 1 rocket. Biopure Corporation was a biopharmaceutical company that specialized in oxygen therapeutics (blood substitutes) for both human and veterinary use.  The company developed, manufactured, and marketed oxygen therapeutics, designed to transport oxygen to the body's tissues.  The oxygen technology uses hemoglobin-based oxygen carrying molecules in solution (HBOCs) to increase oxygen transfer to the tissues.  The competing companies with Biopure were Allied Pharmaceutical, Northfield Laboratories, Baxter International and Hemosol of Toronto.  The company developed two products: Hemopure (HBOC-1) <nowiki>[hemoglogin glutamer-250 (bovine)]</nowiki> for human use, and Oxyglobin (HBOC-301) <nowiki>[hemoglobin glutamer-200 (bovine)]</nowiki> for veterinary use.  As of April 2001, Hemopure was approved for commercial sale in South Africa for treatment of acute anemia in general surgery.  However, Hemopure has not been able to gain approval in the U.K. or the U.S. because of safety and reliability concerns of the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) respectively.  The company formed an agreement with the U.S. Navy to aid in preclinical testing of Hemopure for out-of-hospital treatment of trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock.  Oxyglobin is the only oxygen therapeutic approved for treatment of canine anemia in both Europe and the U.S. and has treated thousands of cases.  Unable to obtain FDA approval for Hemopure to date, Biopure ceased operations in 2009 and its assets were purchased by OPK Biotech LLC in September 2009.  On July 16, 2009 Biopure announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code and entered into an agreement with OPK Biotech LLC for the sale of substantially all of its assets . The Hawker P.1127 and the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA.1 were the experimental and development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first \"vertical and/or short take-off and landing\" (V/STOL) jet fighter-bomber.  Kestrel development began in 1957, taking advantage of the Bristol Engine Company's choice to invest in the creation of the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine.  Testing began in July 1960 and by the end of the year the aircraft had achieved both vertical take-off and horizontal flight.  The test program also explored the possibility of use upon aircraft carriers, landing on HMS \"Ark Royal\" in 1963.  The first three aircraft crashed during testing, one at the 1963 Paris Air Show. The Rolls-Royce Peregrine was a 21 l , 885 hp liquid-cooled V-12 aero engine designed and built by the British manufacturer Rolls-Royce in the late 1930s.  It was essentially the ultimate development of the company's Kestrel engine, which had seen widespread use in military aircraft of the pre-war period. The Rolls-Royce Eagle XVI was a British experimental 16 cylinder aero engine designed and developed by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1925.  The engine was test run but did not fly, the project was cancelled in favour of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel that was being developed concurrently. Dimadis-Kanakis (since 1986 Kanakis E.P.E.) is a historic Greek engine and metal products manufacturer, based in Volos.  It was founded in 1920 by Pavlos Dimadis and Ioannis Kanakis, initially focusing on engine repair and rebuilding.  In 1926 the company developed and produced its first semi-diesel engines (10-60 hp, mostly for boat power).  Soon an extended range of engine models, up to 120 hp, was developed and the company became one of the best known Greek engine makers, mostly remembered for the reliability of its products.  Some exports were also made. The Rolls-Royce Buzzard (also referred to as the H engine) was a British piston aero engine of 36.7 L capacity that produced about 800 hp .  Designed and built by Rolls-Royce Limited it featured 12 cylinders in a 'V' configuration of 6 in bore and 6.6 in stroke.  It was manufactured in the late 1920s, but only 100 were sold.  A further development was the Rolls-Royce R Schneider Trophy engine.  The Buzzard was developed by scaling-up the Kestrel engine in the ratio of 5:6.",
